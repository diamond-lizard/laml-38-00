     I have made a new compatibility file in lib/compatibility called star_star_mzscheme-200.scm.
     Currently it covers all mzscheme 200+ needs, on both unix and windows. It may be desirable to 
     make a slightly better unix version in the future. - I have made a &#39;hack&#39; in the 
     LAML configuration program such that the exec files and the emacs stuff are taken from 
     the old mzscheme configuration when mzscheme-200 is requested. In that way fewer files
     are needed in the configuration part of LAML.</p> <p>Some Scheme programs and LAML documents contain backslashes.  MzScheme 200+ has a different interpretation of the 
     escaping backslash character in strings than version 103 and 101. In LAML version 19 and beyond we have addapted SchemeDoc
     to deal with the strict interpretation of backslashes in strings (only \&quot; and \\ are well-defined). In that way, both SchemeDoc and the Scheme Elucidator
     runs with MzScheme200+.</p> <div>&nbsp; <p> Kurt N&oslash;rmark <br> <a href = "mailto:normark@cs.auc.dk">normark@cs.auc.dk</a> <br> <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/">http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/</a></div></body></html>

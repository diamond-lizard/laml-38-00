      <h1>Link Checking in LAML</h1>
      <p>The facilities described below are available from LAML version 29.</p>
      <p>
         For a long time, LAML has been able to validate attributes and contents. Recently also
         checking for proper use of ID attributes has been introduced.</p>
      <p>
         Linking errors are a major source of frustration in web documents. Concretely, we have
         the problem if an URL points to a non-existing web resource. Therefore it
         is - from a practical point of view - very useful to check all links when
         the document is generated. This is now possible in LAML. LAML is able to check
         for relative links, with and without an explicitly given base URL (given by
         the
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/mirrors/man/xhtml10-transitional-mirror.html#base">
            base</a>
         element of XHTML, for instance) and absolute links. Checking for absolute links requires
         an implementation of the LAML compatibility function
         <a href="../lib/compatibility/man/mzscheme-compat.html#url-target-exists?">
            url-target-exists?</a>.
         (If you use MzScheme, LAML has such an implementation. However, in LAML version 29
         this function does not give accurate results!)</p>
      <p>
         The variable
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#xml-link-checking">
            xml-link-checking</a>
         (in the library lib/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm) controls the amount of link checking.
         You can ask for no link checking, checking of relative links, checking of
         absolute links, and checking of all links. See the documentation of the variable
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#xml-link-checking">
            xml-link-checking</a>.</p>
      <p>
         When you use an XHTML language in LAML everything is provided for you. The default
         value of
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#xml-link-checking">
            xml-link-checking</a>
         provides for checking of relative links. </p>
      <p>
         Some supported XML languages in LAML come with an URL extractor function, and a base
         URL extractor function. They are returned by the higher-order functions
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#url-extractor-of-xml-language">
            url-extractor-of-xml-language</a>
         and 
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#base-url-extractor-of-xml-language">
            base-url-extractor-of-xml-language</a>.
         The function
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#set-xml-link-checking-functions">
            set-xml-link-checking-functions</a>
         is used to define the URL extractor function and a base URL extractor function.
         The mirror function library calls this function with appropriate URL extractor functions.</p>
      <p>Link checking in LAML works as follows:</p>
      <ol>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <b>Document generation</b>
            <br />
            The document is generated as usual. This gives a LAML AST of the document.</li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <b>Link collection</b>
            <br />
            The function
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#collect-links-for-later-checking-in-ast!">
               collect-links-for-later-checking-in-ast!</a>
            is called on the AST. This function collects all URLs, which must be
            checked. Two global variables
            <kbd>relative-url-list-for-later-checking</kbd>
            and
            <kbd>absolute-url-list-for-later-checking</kbd>
             are hereby assigned. The second parameter of
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#collect-links-for-later-checking-in-ast!">
               collect-links-for-later-checking-in-ast!</a>
            gives the absolute file path of the location, where the file is written
            in the file system (the base URL). This information is important for
            checking of relative links in static web documents. Notice that the
            collection of links cannot be done before we know the file location of the document.</li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <b>Relative link checking</b>
            <br />
            The function
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#check-relative-url-list!">
               check-relative-url-list!</a>
            checks the existence of resources addressed by the URLs in
            <kbd>relative-url-list-for-later-checking</kbd>.
            This boils down to file and directory existence checks.
            Problems are addressed via the function
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#xml-check-error">
               xml-check-error</a>.
            Notice that link checking should be done as late as possible, after all more or
            less dependent files have been written.</li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <b>Absolute link checking</b>
            <br />
            The function
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#check-absolute-url-list!">
               check-absolute-url-list!</a>
            checks the existence of resources addressed by the URLs in
            <kbd>absolute-url-list-for-later-checking</kbd>.
            This function relies on the LAML compatibility function
            <a href="../lib/compatibility/man/mzscheme-compat.html#url-target-exists?">
               url-target-exists?</a>
            (for which we do not yet have a good implementation in the LAML distribution).
            Errors are reported as for relative links.</li></ol>
      <p>
         In the standard LAML setup, step 2 is done by
         <a href="../man/laml.html#write-html">write-html</a>,
         when a document is rendered (linearized and written to a file). You can alternatively
         do it &#39;manually&#39; from other contexts, of course.</p>
      <p>
         Step 3 and 4 are done from the function
         <a href="../man/laml.html#end-laml">end-laml</a>.
          Again, you can check the collected links yourself, using the functions described
         about, if you need to.</p>
      <p>Notice that anchor parts, following &#39;#&#39; in a URL, are not checked by LAML.</p>
      <p>
         The link checking framework, as described in this document, can be used on pre-existing
         XML languages as well as on your own XML languages. Just provide URL extractor
         functions for you own XML language, install them with
         <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#set-xml-link-checking-functions">
            set-xml-link-checking-functions</a>,
         and arrange for link collection and link checking (using the functions from above).
         Notice, however, that your own XML language typically is translated to XHTML, which
         will check it&#39;s links. Therefore, it is not always necessary to do a lot of
         link checking in your own, high-level XML languages.</p>
      <p>
         A single end remark for relative links. It is better to prevent errors than to find
         them at a later point in time. When you make relative links in LAML, the Emacs
         command
         <b>M-x insert-relative-file-path</b>
         is
         <em>very useful</em>
         together with the embedding Emacs command (with
         <b>M-x embed</b>).</p>

      <h1>LAML with MzScheme 300+ on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 7</h1>
      <p>
         From version 32 of LAML, LAML works very well with MzScheme 300+ on Windows (2000,
         XP, and will also assumed on Windows 7).</p>
      <p>
         Improvements of the LAML compatibility library in version 32 of LAML: The consequences
         of block buffering has been alleviated by forcing line buffering of the current
         outputport. In addition, a (tricky) redefinition of the function directory-list
         has been revised and corrected. In earlier versions of LAML (with MzScheme 300) this
         redefinition caused major problems in many LAML programs. Finally, the function
         sort-list has been redefined such that it now works in both version 299-301,
         and in version 350+ of MzScheme.</p>
      <p>
         Be aware that MzScheme 300+ relies on Unicode internally. Thus, you should make sure
         that your LAML files are written and saved using UTF-8 encoding. If you use
         an 8-bit encoding, such as ISO-Latin-1, you can expect strange results if
         you use national characters, such as in the Danish, and German alphabet. </p>
      <p>
         On Windows, LAML version 32 has been tested with MzSchme 370. Everything works fine.
         All examples run.</p></body></html>

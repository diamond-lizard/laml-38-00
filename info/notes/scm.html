      <h1>LAML with SCM</h1>
      <p>Version 27: Not yet tested with SCM</p>
      <h2>Historical Remarks:</h2>
      <p>
         The notes below are all historial pre-version 26 remarks. The remarks are appropriate
         for version 20.
      </p>
      <p>
         SCM is Aubrey Jaffer&#39;s excellent Scheme system, which we used in the early days of
         the development of LAML. Also for CGI programming efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
         We left SCM, mostly because our system staff on Solaris had a hard time installing
         new versions. The last few years I have not used SCM with LAML on Solaris.
      </p>
      <p>
         I installed SCM version 5d7 and SLIB version 2d5 (most recent versions as of May 2003)
         on Red Hat Linux. This was very easy due to existence of RPM&#39;s for
         both, cf.
         <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SCM.html">Jaffer&#39;s SCM page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         In the same way as for Guile and MzScheme-200, I adapted the existing SCM compatibility
         file and made it generic for all platforms and all operating systems:
         <kbd>lib/compatibility/star_star_scm.scm</kbd>.
      </p>
      <p>The following minor problems exist for SCM in relation to LAML:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            I could not figure out how to implement the compatiblity function
            <kbd>bound?</kbd>
             A macro
            <kbd>defined?</kbd>
            exist in SCM, but it does not evaluate its parameter, of course. Thus
            (as noticed in newsgroups and mailing lists),
            <kbd>defined?</kbd>
            in Guile and
            <kbd>defined?</kbd>
            in SCM differs.
         </li>
         <li>
            I could not figure out how to ask for case sensitive reading. This affects the SVG
            mirror.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>All other aspects of LAML seems to work very well together with SCM</p>
      <p>
         I will assume that SCM (using the same compatibility file as for Linux) also works
         on Solaris, but it remains to be proven.

      <h1>LAML with Guile on Linux</h1>
      <p>Guile is the GNU people&#39;s Scheme system.</p>
      <p>
         I every now and then test LAML with Guile on Red Hat Linux. As of September
         2009 I have tested LAML version 35 with Guile version 1.8.7. It seems to work
         OK, but MzScheme version 209 is faster than Guile version 1.8.7.</p>
      <p>
         Maybe due to the use of R5RS macros, (use-syntax (ice-9 syncase)), Guile 1.6
         is/was
         <b>slow</b>
         with LAML. It is not, however, clear if Guile 1.6 is slower than Guile 1.8.</p>
      <p>
         The use of Guile on Linux may be convenient for many Linux users, because Guile
         is probably present on your Linux machine already. Try call
         <kbd>guile</kbd>
         from the command prompt, with the -v option to find out about which version
         you have. Use
         <kbd>which guile</kbd>
         to find out where it is located in the file system.</p>
      <p>
         I have experienced that older versions (1.3 and 1.4) of Guile also work well with LAML
         on Linux. But they are not tested with LAML 26. As of LAML version 35, I have
         disabeled the support of version 1.4 (and older) of Guile. If you want to used LAML
         with an old version of Guile, please consult the compatibility file in
         <kbd>lib/compatibility/star_star_guile.scm</kbd>.
          </p>
      <p>Version 27: Tested and OK - but slow.</p></body></html>

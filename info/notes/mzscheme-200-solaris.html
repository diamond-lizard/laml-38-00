      <h1>LAML with MzScheme 200 on Solaris.</h1>
      <p>I have tested LAML 26 on Solaris 2.9 with MzScheme 205.</p>
      <p>
         As of 2009, were LAML version 35 is the current version, we do not use Solaris any
         more. Therefore I cannot test most recent version of LAML on Solaris. </p>
      <p>
         As of January 2005 we use MzScheme version 205 on Red Hat Linux and on Solaris. Everything
         in LAML runs perfectly in this version of MzScheme. We also use MzScheme 205 for CGI
         purposes.</p>
      <p>Version 27: Tested and OK.</p>
      <p><b>Some historical remarks - pre version 26:</b></p>
      <p>
         About LAML configuration and MzScheme 200+: I have made a new compatibility file
         in lib/compatibility called star_star_mzscheme-200.scm. Currently it covers all
         mzscheme 200+ needs, on both unix and windows. I have made a &#39;hack&#39; in the LAML
         configuration program such that the exec files and the emacs stuff are taken from
         the old mzscheme configuration when mzscheme-200 is requested. In that way fewer
         files are needed in the configuration part of LAML.</p>
      <p>
         Some Scheme programs and LAML documents contain backslashes. MzScheme 200+ has a different
         interpretation of the escaping backslash character in strings than version 103
         and 101. In LAML version 19 and beyond we have addapted SchemeDoc to deal with
         the strict interpretation of backslashes in strings (only \&quot; and \\ are well-defined).
         In that way, both SchemeDoc, the Scheme Elucidator, and other tools run with
         MzScheme200+.</p>
      <p>
         When we eventually stop using MzScheme 101 on Solaris, also for CGI, we will probably
         make a specific compatibility file for MzScheme 200+ on Solaris. Until then,
         the generic star_star_mzscheme-200.scm. is fine.</p>
      <p>
         I have used MzScheme 200+ (all versions) on Windows 2000 since it appeared. MzScheme
         200+ works fine also on Solaris. However, we still use version 101 in our daily use
         of LAML on Solaris. This also holds for CGI programs. It would be trivial
         to start using MzScheme 200+ for static LAML processing. It will take some
         efforts to convert to MzScheme 200+ with respect the LAML-based CGI programs, because
         they all start like this: </p>
      <pre>#!/bin/sh
 
string=? ; exec /pack/mzscheme/bin/mzscheme -r $0 &quot;$@&quot;

        software, with special emphasis on the installation process and
        its consequences on a particular LAML configuration. <p> The  <a href = "laml-easy-installation.html">LAML installation process</a>  is driven by a Scheme program, which
        must be called by the the person who install LAML. Thus, the installation of LAML is not
        as easy as you may expect from state-of-the-art Windows installation
        procedures.  On the other hand, our experience shows that most people
        are able to carry through the few steps in the LAML installation procedure
        without problems.  The installation process writes a number of
        important files into your file system (all in the LAML directory, with the .emacs
        file as an exception). The file  <a href = "../laml.scm">laml.scm</a>  is of
        particular importance, see below. It is located in the root directory
        of your LAML system. If you prepare to use Emacs for activation of
        LAML, the  <a href = "../laml.el">laml.el</a>  file is also important (also in the LAML root).
        The  <a href = "../emacs-support/">emacs-support/</a>  directory contains other important Emacs lisp files.
        The installation process also produces a  <a href = "../emacs-support/dot-emacs-contribution.el">contribution</a>  to your .emacs file. <p> Each triple (scheme-system, platform, operating-system) has its own
        compatibility file in LAML, see the directory  <a href = "../lib/compatibility">lib/compatibility</a>. A
        compatibility file contains a few non-standard (non R4RS) Scheme functions used in
        LAML. In addition, it contains the functions which transfer context
        information to LAML, because the implementation of these are bound to be
        system dependent. <p> Now about  <a href = "../laml.scm">laml.scm</a>.  This file must be loaded as the first thing in
        any LAML program, including CGI programs that use LAML. Details about your configuration is hard-wired in
         <kbd>laml.scm</kbd>. In addition it loads the appropriate compatibility file from
         <kbd>lib/compatibility</kbd>  and the  <kbd>general</kbd>  library from lib. <p> After the loading of  <a href = "../laml.scm">laml.scm</a>, a style file will normally be
        loaded. There are styles for a number of purposes in the LAML
        distribution. And you can easily write your own style. A style should always
        load a HTML mirror, either one of the new accurate mirrors, such as <a href = "../lib/xml-in-laml/mirrors/man/xhtml10-transitional-mirror.html">XHTML1.0</a>, or one of the other
        mirrors. You are recommended to use  <kbd>lib/xml-in-laml/mirrors/xhtml10-transitional-mirror.scm</kbd> or one the sibling XHTML mirrors. You can use <kbd>lib/html4.01-transitional-validating/html4.scm</kbd> , but you should not use <kbd>lib/html.scm</kbd> and <kbd>lib/html-v1.scm</kbd>, which only are provided for backward compatibility. <p> As of 2003, the kernel of LAML allows you to generate mirrors of XML languages form XML DTDs.
             XHTML and SVG are supported via such mirrors, and as part of our work with LAML we have created a number of additional XML
             language. LAML has its own <a href = "../tools/dtd-parser/man/dtd-parser.html">XML DTD parser</a> and a <a href = "../tools/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html">mirror generation tool</a> for creation of
             mirrors of XML languages
             in Scheme. Given an LAML (XML-in-LAML) document in some high-level XML language, it can be transformed
             to a lower-level XML language. The target XML language is often XHTML. LAML provides a simple 
              <a href = "../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#SECTION18">transformation framework</a> for this.
             The <a href = "../tutorial/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.html">XML-in-LAML tutorial</a> is a good place to start. <p> There are also a number of  <a href = "../man/laml.html#SECTION7">LAML tools</a>  for various purposes. These can
        use a style, but they do not need to. A tool is typically started by a
        tiny LAML file which serves as a script that calls some underlying
        functionality implemented in Scheme. <p> In order to use LAML you make a file, say  <kbd>f.laml</kbd>. You arrange that
         <a href = "../laml.scm">laml.scm</a>  is loaded. It is done in various ways, depending on whether
        you work via Emacs, via command file (shell), or within a Scheme
        system. In all cases we attempt to transfer information about the
        startup-directory and the source file name to the LAML program. This
        is called  <em>context information</em>. When the LAML program  <kbd>f.laml</kbd>  runs it
        usually writes a file  <kbd>f.html</kbd>  in the same directory as  <kbd>f.laml</kbd>.  (In
        some situations other effects can be experienced or provided for, however). The LAML Emacs
        interface supports this process in a very flexible way (via a single key stroke). <p> If you happen to use a non-supported Scheme system or a non-supported
        platform you will have to port LAML. There is a detailed  <a href = "porting-laml.html">cookbook</a>  for
        this. Here we will be concerned with the overall picture. The first
        thing is to implement the compatibility file. This is the file in the
         <a href = "../lib/compatibility">lib/compatibility</a>  directory; A compatibility file must
        be named in particular way, as explained in the porting
        cookbook. This part of the porting is usually not that hard. Next
        comes the support of various ways to activate LAML. The easiest
        solution is just to call a procedure called  <kbd>laml</kbd>  from you Scheme
        prompt. In the current version, this solution is quite good. 
        You can also activate LAML from a command prompt (a shell).
        This requires that you write a
        template of such a shell command with a particular name. The
        installation process will bring it to the proper place (the  <kbd>bin</kbd>  directory) in the file system and make certain
        substitutions. The best and most ideal solution is to implement LAML
        activation from Emacs. This is ideal, but most useful for people who
        already are used to Emacs. In order to support this you must implement
        three Elisp activation functions, which brings the necessary LAML
        context from Emacs to LAML. This part of the porting process is probably
        the most difficult. However, a number of versions exists, so you can
        be inspirred by existing stuff. <p> <div>&nbsp; <p> Kurt N&#248;rmark <br> <a href = "mailto:normark@cs.aau.dk">normark@cs.aau.dk</a> <br> <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/">http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/</a></div> <p> <p> <p> <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/laml/"><img src = "../images/laml-power-icon-1.gif" alt = "Program Oriented Web Engineering - using LAML"></a> &nbsp; <p> &nbsp; <p> <font size = "1" color = "#ff0000">Generated: May 6, 2005, 18:55:25</font></body></html>

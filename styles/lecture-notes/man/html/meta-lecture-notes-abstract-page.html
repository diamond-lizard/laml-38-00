   The material is organized as one page per 'means of expression' in the LENO system.
   Thus, on each slide page in the following you will see a description and a demonstration of
   a single LENO tag. In addition, we link to the LENO source from which the present pages have been produced.
   (For this purpose we use one of useful capabilities of LENO; the ability to extract information from an external text file
    and to display this information on a WEB page).<p>The LENO lecture note system features a set of slides, a set of annotated slides, an aggregated lecture note, an index,
   and various overview pages.
   There is a substantial overlap between the information in the slides and the lecture notes. 
   The slides, the annotated slides, and the lecture note are different views on the same underlying information.<p>In order to navigate to the slide or the annotated slide views please follow the 'slide' and 'note' links in the right margin below</font></em></font></td></tr></table>&nbsp;<p><a href = "meta-lecture-notes-slide-section1.html" ><font size = "2" color = "#919191" >Start</font></a><br></center></body></html><!-- Generated from an LAML (Lisp Abstracted Markup Language) source file.

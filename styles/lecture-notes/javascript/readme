The keyboard navigation Javascritp scripts.

Notice that there are two versions of lenonavigate.js in this directory:

  lenonavigate-single.js supports mouse advancement via single mouse clicks on the background.
  lenonavigate-double.js supports mouse advancement via double mouse clicks on the background.

If dynamic loading of javascript is called for and if javascript-loading is #t,
we copy the file lenonavigate-single.js or lenonavigate-double.js from this directory
to html/javascript/lenonavigate.js in the notes directory. 

Notice that only one of lenonavigate-single.js and lenonavigate-double.js is actually used.


September 2002: Now only lenonavigate-double.js is used. Single/double mouse click navigation
is not supported any more. lenonavigate-double.js now works in both mozilla, IE, and netscape.

The Scheme Elucidator 2.

The Scheme Elucidator 2 is developed on the ground of the
original Elucidator software, found in ../../elucidator/ .

Major changes:

  - New XML-in-LAML front end
  - XHTML backend
  - CSS stylesheet support 
  - December 2004: Version support.

There is no code overlap between the Scheme Elucidator 2 and the
original Elucidator.  The orginal Elucidator will not be developed or
supported any more. However, original Elucdiator software will stay
intact, as of version 23 of LAML.

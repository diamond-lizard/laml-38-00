(((title . "The Scheme Elucidator 2 Reference Manual ") (author . "Kurt N\370rmark normark@cs.auc.dk") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science Aalborg University Denmark") (abstract . "This is the manual of the Scheme Elucidator 2. The Scheme Elucidator 2 is major new release of the original Scheme Elucidator. The Scheme Elucidator 2 uses an XML in LAML setup file, and it supports an XML in LAML documentation format. \n            The original documentation format, based on a simple, special-purpose markup language, is still supported. From LAML version 26, the Scheme Elucidator 2 also supports multiple versions of a source file.\n             This represents another significant change of the tool. Most important, this manual documents the Elucidator 2 XML-in-LAML language. In addition, we give a practical\n             introduction to the Scheme Elucidator. We also provide documentation of the original textual documentation format,\n             and a description of support for Elucidative Programming in Emacs. You are invited to look at the examples, which comes with the Elucidator 2 and LAML. The LAML Tutorial is another example of documentation produced with the Scheme Elucidator 2. The paper Scheme Program Documentation Tools and the accompanying examples are also relevant. For information about Elucidative Programming consult the Elucidative Programming Home Page. The source program of the Scheme Elucidator is available as an Elucidative Program. At this point in time, the documentation has not been updated from\n               the original Elucidator to the Elucidator 2. Notice, in this context, that this particular elucidative program\n               illustrates the new version facility of the tool.") (scheme-source-file . not-provided) (laml-resource .

From Emacs type use the command M-x elucidator-help to get brief help on the Elucidator editor commands. For more complete information see the section Emacs Support in this manual. The command M-x elucidate on an elucidator buffer activates the Elucidator from Emacs. The Elucidator is the tool which produces the web pages which presents the documentation bundle as set of HTML files. The main file is found in html/index.html. In addition, if the setup file is called f.laml, the main file is available as f.html in the source directory. Please notice the Tools > Scheme Elucidator menu in Emacs.

However, within the name binding lists, comments are allowed at every position. lambda forms: Comments are not allowed within the list of formal parameters. syntax-rules forms: Comments are only allowed within the patterns and the templates.

The textual format is inserted into the documentation by means of the element documentation-from. If the textual documentation form is used, the elements defined in the previous sections are not used. First we describe the documentation intro (corresponding to the function  documentation-intro ): .TITLE       title\r\n.AUTHOR      author\r\n.EMAIL       email\r\n.AFFILIATION affiliation\r\n.ABSTRACT\r\nabstract\r\n.END After the documentation intro comes a number of documentation sections: (corresponding to the function  documentation-section ): .SECTION id\r\n.TITLE title\r\n.BODY\r\nbody-text\r\n.END Finally, in between sections we have documentation entries (corresponding to the function  documentation-entry ) .ENTRY id\r\n.TITLE title\r\n.BODY\r\nbody-text\r\n.END The templates shown above corresponds exactly to the insertions done by the Emacs lisp template functions, which are described in the last part of this manual. Inside the body text of sections and entries you can make links to program fragments, or more precisely, to the definitions in a Scheme program. Using the notation  {+f}  a weak link to the definition of  f  is created.  This corresponds to (weak-prog-ref 'name \"f\"). Here we just mention  f  without explaining it. Using  {*f}  creates a strong link at a place, where  f  is explained. This corresponds to (strong-prog-ref 'name \"f\"). Using  {-f}  creates a typographical emphasis of  f , but no linking This corresponds to (typographic-prog-ref 'name \"f\"). In all three cases above we can qualify f with a file name. The general format of program reference is     {modifier-char file $ name}  where modifier is a single key '*', '+', or '-'. File is a key name which refers to a file, as defined in a program-source form. name is the name of a definition in a Scheme file. The notation {file$}, which is a special case of the item from above, creates a link a program file. File is a key name which refers to a file, as defined in a program-source form. The notation  [d]  creates a link to another documentation section or entry;  d  is the  id  if the section/entry. This corresponds to (doc-ref 'name \"f\"). If  {f}  is used without a leading +, *, or -, the value of the variable  default-program-link  determines the default kind of linking from documentation to program. Possible values of  default-program-link  is one of the symbols  weak ,  strong , or  none . If  {f} ,  {+f} ,  {*f} , or  {file:f}  does not refer to a program name in the documentation bundle, as defined by the  program-source  clauses, we attempt to link to a manual entry, as defined by the  manual-source  clauses. It is possible to mark a particular place in program by means of a source marker. A source marker in a program must be at a comment place, and it is denoted by  @x , where  x  is a letter in the interval [a..o]. @a corresponds to ( source-marker 'name \"a\") A source marker in a program, such as  @a , must be followed by blank space (a space, CR, etc). Source markers can also be used in the documentation, in which they link to the detailed program place via the closest, preceding strong documentation/program link. Make sure that you do not use the same source marker to refer to places in different definitions within a single section or entry in the documentation.")) ((section-id "emacs") (kind "manual-section") (section-title "Emacs support") (section-body "Using Emacs (GNU Emacs on either windows or unix) there exists a substantial support of elucidative programming. The main idea is to keep track of all the files in a bundle. We support a splitted frame in Emacs, with documentation in the top-most window, and a program in the bottom window in an Emacs frame. We will now describe the Emacs editor commands which support elucidative programming. These are defined in the Emacs lisp file 'elucidator.el' which resides in the same directory as the 'elucidator.scm' program (which implements the Elucidator tool). The keybindings given below correspond to the hygienic keybindings. If you use the original LAML keybindings you should, in general disregard the initial C-c. Command Key binding Effect make-elucidator none Make the directory structure of a new elucidator and establish a setup file based on information retrieved via prompting. Also make a template of the documentation file. As the first thing you should call elucidate on the setup buffer. This will cause the rest of the files to be created, including the necessary gif icons. Finally you should use setup-elucidator to make all the elucidator editor buffers, and to prepare for the programming and documentation process. setup-elucidator none Set up the elucidator on an existing laml setup file, which must be an laml file. If f.laml is selected, a textual documentation is assumed to in file f.txt. If LAML style documentation is used, the documentation file is identical with the LAML setup file. refresh-elucidator C-c C-e r Refresh the program knowledge established by the LAML processing part of the elucidator. This affect the cross referencing capabilities of the editor part, and it (re)defines the source files on which the elucidator works. The information is taken from the internal directory. reset-elucidator C-c C-e C-r Reestablish a situation where the documentation and program is shown in a two window configuration, the documentation above the program goto C-c C-e g  C-c C-e C-h A generic navigation command which can be used inside the textual documentation format or the LAML documentation format. If used on a defined name in a Scheme source program (in the head of a Scheme define form) go to the place this definition is documented. If used on an applied name go to the definition of the name. back C-c C-e C-b Reverse the effect of the previous goto prog-ref C-c C-e C-p Insert a program reference (in curly brackets) in the documentation.

You are prompted for one of the programs in the documentation bundle elucidate C-c C-e C-o Run the elucidator on the setup file of the current documentation bundle. This command can be activated from an arbitrary buffer in the documentation bundle save-elucidator-buffers none Saves all the buffers in the documentation bundle quit-elucidator none Save elucidator buffers and kill them all. Reset the state of elucidator. elucidator-help C-c C-e ? Shows brief elucidator help information in Emacs In addition, we support a number of insert functions which allows template insertion. These functions are all defined as part of LAML emacs lisp template facility. The template insertions commands are: Command Key binding Effect insert-documentation-section C-c C-e C-x Insert a documentation section using the textual format insert-documentation-entry C-c C-e C-c Insert a documentation entry using the textual format Any command described above is activated by M-x command (i.e., Esc X command) or via the keyboard bindings described above. A Emacs menu of Elucidator commands is available under Tools > Scheme Elucidator. In addition, the generic LAML Emacs commands are useful when you write LAML style documentation in this tool.")))

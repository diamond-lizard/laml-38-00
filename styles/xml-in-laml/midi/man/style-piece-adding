Adding style pieces:

For <i> from 1 .. 16:

Add a midi piece - from a midi file - via use of the attribute addMidiPart<i>
The value of this attribute is an absolute file path to the midi file.

The attribute addAsCannel<i> controls the channel assigned to the added piece.

The attribute repetitions<i> controls the number of repetitions of the pieces. Default value is 1. It is
assumed that the piece is shorter or equal to (* ppqn partLengthQN<i>), where partLengthQN<i>
is annother attribute. Enfore the number of repetition, and enforce that each repetition has the
length of (* ppqn partLengthQN<i>). partLengthQN<i> is required if repetitions<i> is larger than one.

The attribute limitQN is used to enforce an upper limit of the length of a part.
limitQN is mandatory, because it is necessary (very desirable) to cut off too long durations.
limitQN is shared between all additions to a section, such as MainA. For fills, limitQN is automatically set to 
the number of quarter notes of a bar (the bar length).

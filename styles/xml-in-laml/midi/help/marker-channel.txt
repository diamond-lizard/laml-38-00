HOW TO MAKE MARKERS.

Overview: Markers are Meta events of type 6 (markers) which can be
entered at the keyboard in a designated channel, and subsequently
transformed to Meta events via the Midi LAML function marker-channel.
Only use marker-channel in a context where the counterTransposition is 0.

Details:

At the Keyboard:
  * Select an unused channel, be sure that the transposition is zero, and
    adjust volume to zero.
    Deselect ACMP, and make sure that recording starts at the begining and that
    it goes to the very end.
    Be also sure to turn off harmony/echo.

  * During recording, Use white keys in an arbitray octave for marking purposes:

       C is marker level 0
       D is marker level 1
       E is marker level 2
       ...
       H is marker level 6

    If you use black keys, these are mapped downwards to closest white key.

  * Typically: 
       C is used at the beginning of a song line
       D is used for the beginning of a verse.
       E is used at the beginning of a song part.

  * Small errors (use of wrong keys) can relatively easy be adjusted at this point
    in time.

At the Computer with Midi LAML:

  * Surround the contents of the song with the function (marker-channel ch ...),
    where ch is the channel used for marking. This will introduce Meta markers,
    and it will remove Control and Program events of the channels. Initially,
    meta marker 0 of level 2, corresponding to key E, is introduced automatically.

Marker Browser:

  * Create a Marker Browser via the Menu (Marker Browser of Selected Track)
    or C-c m, or M-x make-marker-region-browser. Before that, be sure to 
    locate the point in the track which contains the markers.

  * The Marker Browser allows browsing, playing a selected region, adding of
    textual comments, and displaying the length of a region.

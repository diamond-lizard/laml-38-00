HELP ON MIDL STACK.

The Midl stack is used to maintain a stack of Midi LAML buffers.
Typically, Scheme expressions are evaluated and the result is pushed
as a new entry on the stack, using "Process, save and push source".

Here follows some information and tips about the Midl Stack:

"Pop and reestablish source" (C-c C-o).
  Eliminate the top of the stack. It is, however, possible to 
  undo the pop operation (with C-c C-y)  because popped elements are pushed onto
  a ghost stack. 

"Reset Midl Stack":
  Keep current stack entry, and delete all other entries.
  Also delete ghost entries. After this operation, only one
  entry is on the stack (the buffer shown when you started this
  operation).

"Get rid of ghost elements":
  The gost stack is cleared when you push a new element on the stack, or
  when you explicitly clear it with "Get rid of ghost elements".

"Replicate current buffer - undo all pops":
  You can use this command to pick a buffer somewhere in the stack,
  and push it at the very top of the stack. Before pushing, all ghost
  elements are turned into ordinary elements on the stack.
  Use C-c C-o and C-c C-y to navigate the stack. 

"Push latest temp selection":
  Push the latest temporary "sel-temp.midl" file, which is the result of 
  processing a selection of a midl file.

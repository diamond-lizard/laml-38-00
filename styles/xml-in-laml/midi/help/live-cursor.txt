ABOUT LIVE CURSOR

When the tempo is low (slow playing) it makes sense to follow the
playing with a moving cursor in Emacs. This is called 'Live
Cursor'. It works together with the command line player.

Live cursor movement is tricky in the MIDI LAML Emacs because the
cursor movement and the playing is not really synchronized. Emacs does not
have access to real-time MIDI playing! We simulate a moving cursor by pre-calculating
the cursor move pattern.

It is possible to tune the live cursor movement paramters with a couple of
commands.  They are found in the menu

    MIDL > Live Cursor > ...

The following editor commands are also relevant:

  - The M-x set-instrument command attempts to estimate the startup
    latency of the command line player.

  - The startup latency can be set by the command M-x live-cursor-set-startup-latency,
    which - before setting - informs about the current setting.

The Keypad  + and -  keys are bound the fastening and slowing the live cursor.

The Keypad  Del  key toggle use of live cursor. 

The following Emacs commands may also be useful

  M-x live-cursor-manual-setup    Enter the startup latency and speedup factor as numbers.  
                                  Stacks old values for convenient recovery.
  M-x live-cursor-recover-settings
  M-x live-cursor-info

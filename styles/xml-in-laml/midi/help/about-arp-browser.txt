                            in some Arpeggio types, sounding only when you play
                            notes at a velocity higher (stronger) than that specified in
                            the Accent Velocity Threshold parameter. If it is hard to play
                            at velocities necessary to trigger the Accent Phrase, set
                            the Accent Velocity Threshold parameter to a lower value."

                             which will trigger special sounds (such as guitar fret
                            noises) when the note is released. The following
                            parameters affecting Random SFX are provided."

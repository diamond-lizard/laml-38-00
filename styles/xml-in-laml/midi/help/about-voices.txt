HELP ON VOICES

To address a voice three MIDI messages are used: Two ControlChange message (control 0 and 32, MSB and LSB resp)
and a ProgramChange message. The following Scheme functions abstract these:

  (voice channel msb lsb program-number)
  (voice-with-mix channel msb lsb program-number vol pan revert chorus)
  (gm-voice channel program)                   program is either a program-number or an instrument name
  (voices-from-file [voice-file])              Read and insert voices from a voice file.

Voice Files:
  Voice files (with extension 'voices') are simple list files with voice information.
  It is possible to generate a voice file interactively by MIDL > Voice collection browser, or
  M-x make-voice-collection-from-midl-file. This extracts the voice information from the current
  Midl file and writes them to a file. It also brings up a voice collection brower on the extracted
  voices.

  The Scheme message list function eliminate-voice-messages are useful for getting rid of voice
  information in a MIDI file. 

Voice Collection Browser.
  A voice collection brower can be initiated from an instrument specific voice browser.
  From a MIDI LAML song it is possible to browse the voice collection in the song with MIDL > Voice collection browser.
  A new and fresh voice collection can also be initiated from a song with MIDL > Empty voice collection browser.
  
  New voices are added to a voice collection from an instrument-specific voice browser, such
  as the GM voice browser (initiated with Tools > GM Voice Browser).

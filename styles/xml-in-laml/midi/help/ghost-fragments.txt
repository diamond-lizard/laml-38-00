GHOST FRAGMENTS:

A ghost fragment is a Scheme program fragment which has been applied at some point in time during the process of producing a song 
with use of MIDI LAML. If the MIDL stack is discarded, a number of programmed contribution may be lost. In order to prevent such
a situation, a collection of ghost fragments can be defined before the stack is altered (lowered) dramatically. It is possible to
add program contributions for either the ghost elements of the MIDL stack, or for the whole stack.

It may also be useful to create ghost fragment for the entire project, with the purpose of getting an overview of 
programmed solution accross the entries of the MIDL stack.

Internally, the ghost fragments are kept persistently in the project directory of a development project.

Typical scenario:

 - You have developed a stack with many entries, resulting from normalizing a number of programmed contribution to MIDI LAML files.
   You have applied either your own Scheme functions, or functions from the MIDI LAML function library on your music

 - You unwind the stack, and you want to make a fundamental change near the bottom of the stack.

 - In order not to loose you programming efforts, as spread throughout the stack, you activate
   MIDL Stack > Add ghost fragment and browse.

 - You normalize the stack, hereby loosing all but a few stack entries.

 - With use of the information in the ghost fragment browser, you re-introduce your original programmed solutions. 
   Notice that this typically is a semi-automatic process.

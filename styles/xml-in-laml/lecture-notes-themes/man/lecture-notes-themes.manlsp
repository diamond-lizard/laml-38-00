(((title . "Reference Manual of the Lecture Note Theme System") (author . "Kurt N\370rmark normark@cs.auc.dk") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science Aalborg University Denmark") (abstract . "The LENO Theme system is based on a small XML language in LAML for authoring\n                  of a secondary 'thematic' source.  \n                  The primary source, as authored in the primary LENO language, \n                  constitute the kernel language for authoring of annotated slide material.\n                  The primary LENO language supports three different views: slide view, annotated slide view\n                  and aggregated slide view. The secondary source supports the thematic view, which is extended\n                  with more text than found in the three 'primary views'. \n                  The secondary source can address the elements of the primary source and add new elements theme-text and theme-side-box\n                  elements as well. In this reference manual we document the XML-in-LAML language for authoring\n                  the secondary source.\n                  The best way to start working on a LENO theme is to generate a template of it \n                   from the primary source. Use the attribute theme-source (with the value new) of the leno-front-matters clause\n                   to generate the template. (The template is generated by processing the primary source).\n                   The elements in between section-titles become a theme. If the primary source is located in the file f.leno \n                   the secondary source must be located in f_themes.leno.

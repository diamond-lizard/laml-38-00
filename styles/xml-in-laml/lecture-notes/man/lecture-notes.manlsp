(((title . "Reference Manual of the XML-in-LAML Lecture Note System") (author . "Kurt N\370rmark normark@cs.auc.dk") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science Aalborg University Denmark") (abstract . "This is the reference manual of the LENO Lecture Note System. \n          This manual pertains to the XML-in-LAML interface\n          of LENO. The older interface -  the original LENO system  - is now obsolete. There are also reference manuals of the LENO theme language and the LENO trail language. LENO has its own home page - The LENO Homepage. In case you are interested in a broader introduction to LENO, please consult it. Using LENO it is possible to make web-based teaching material. The collection is structured \n    in chapters. Each chapter is used in a separate lecture. LENO supports a comprehensive\n    linking of slides within a chapter, and linking between the chapters. Overview pages are\n    generated for each chapter, and lecture wide for all chapters. LENO also supports an\n    alphabetic index with links to slides given selected index words, concepts, and slide titles. LENO supports three different\n    views on the slide: Slide view, annotated slide view, and an aggregated slide view.\n    In addition, LENO supports a thematic view via a secondary source file.\n    In slide view, the main text of the slides are shown\n    in using a relatively large font. In the annotated slide view, the slide is shown to\n    the left, and the annotations are shown to the right. \n    In the aggregated slide view, the slide contents and the annotations are mixed into a single,\n    long text with marginal comments.\n    Thematic view of a LENO material comes close to a traditional text book exposition, and it typically contains more information than found in the already mentioned views..\n    Allviews can be seen from any Internet browser,\n    because it is translated to simple and plain HTML. LENO is implemented by means of LAML, which means 'Lisp Abstracted Markup Language'.\n        This version of LENO depends on XML-in-LAML.\n        In LAML a number of Scheme expressions are executed with the purpose to generate HTML\n        counterparts. This document is the reference manual of LENO. It documents the primary user level 'markup' functions, which\n    act as special purpose slide markup functions. The markup functions mirror the elements of the LENO XML language,\n    which is defined by the LENO DTD. There exists a  separate overview of the CSS  support for LENO.\n     This overview has a brief description of the LENO CSS stylesheet support as well. \n     The Meta Lecture Notes gives a concrete example\n      of each Leno means of expression. As a distinguished feature, the example give access to the LENO source\n      using the source-program clause to read relevant parts of the underlying LAML file. Try it out! You should also consult the comprehensive, elucidative  LENO tutorial  which features  a variety of LENO examples. You should also pay attention to the very simple (and somewhat artificial)  introductory LENO examples provided with this software.") (scheme-source-file . not-provided) (laml-resource .

Just initiate the command M-x  make-lecture-notes ,and you are started. Use the templates in the Emacs LENO menu to construct your document. The scheme-suffix attribute of the leno-front-matters clause allows you to read a Scheme file with ordinary Scheme definitions. (This file is loaded after the loading of all LENO software). Use this file to organize ad hoc convenience functions, which help you manage a complex material. There is also a similar scheme-prefix attribute, which you do not need to care about for single chapter materials. The Scheme definitions in the scheme prefix file are read before the LENO software is loaded.")) ((section-id "multi-section") (kind "manual-section") (section-title "Multi lecture materials") (section-body "A multi lecture material consist of a number of LAML source files which each represents a chapter (lecture) in the material. Usually, we organize the common aspects in Scheme prefix and Scheme suffix files, which are shared among all the chapters. The Scheme prefix file, addressed by the scheme-prefix attribute of leno-front-matters clauses, must be present for multi-lecture materials. Here is an example of this file: (define notes-title \"LECTURE NOTE TITLE\")\r\n(define notes-subtitle \"LECTURE NOTE SUBTITLE\")\r\n\r\n(define note-abstract\r\n  \"ABSTRACT\")\r\n\r\n\r\n(define lecture-sections\r\n  (list\r\n     \"lect1\"\r\n     \"lect2\"\r\n     \"lect3\"\r\n  ))\r\n\r\n(define current-lecture (length lecture-sections))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As it appears, the Scheme prefix file defines the note titles, the abstract, and most important a list of lecture names (proper file names of the each lecture/chapter). The variable current-lecture can be set to a value smaller than the length of the lecture-sections, in case you do not want to link to details in the latter chapters yet. The Scheme suffix file, addressed by the scheme-suffix attribute of the leno-front-matters clauses, can contain additional Scheme definitions. The following shows a template of a lecture in a multi lecture LENO material: (load (string-append laml-dir \"laml.scm\"))       \n(laml-style \"lecture-notes/leno\")\n\n(load \"common-front-matters-stuff.scm\")\n\n(leno-front-matters\n  (front-title \"TITLE\")           \n  (front-subtitle \"SUBTITLE\")   \n  (front-author authors)           \n  (front-affiliation institutions)  \n  (front-abstract \"ABSTRACT\")  \n\n  common-attributes\n  'process-all-lectures \"true\"\n)\n\n(begin-notes)\n\n\n  (note-page 'id \"sec-id\"\n    (section-title \"TITLE\")\n  )\n  \n  (note-page 'id \"page-id\"\n    (title (main-text \"TITLE\")\n           (annotation \"ANNOTATION\")\n    )\n\n    (point\n     (main-text \"TEXT OF POINT\")\n     (annotation \"ANNOTATION OF POINT\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n(end-notes)\n\n\n Notice the loading of 'common-front-matters-stuff.scm' which conveniently define a number of properties shared by the leno-front-matters clauses in all lectures. (We cannot define this in the scheme-prefix or scheme-suffix clauses, because these are first brought to the attention of LENO through the leno-front-matters clause itself.) Here is a typical 'common-front-matters-stuff.scm' file: (define authors \"AUTHORS\")\r\n(define institutions \"AFFILIATIONS\")\r\n\r\n\r\n(define common-attributes\r\n (list\r\n\r\n  'scheme-prefix \"pre-notes.scm\"\r\n  'scheme-suffix \"post-notes.scm\"\r\n\r\n  'course-home-url \"http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/\"   \r\n  'author-home-url \"http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/\"   \r\n  'note-download-url \"\"   \r\n  'logo-url \"\"  \r\n  'note-contents-description \"\"    \r\n  'slide-header \"normal\"  ; minimal/normal/none \r\n  'trail-of-lecture \"false\"  \r\n  'language \"english\"      \r\n  'show-and-speak \"false\" \r\n    'default-showing-time \"2\"    \r\n    'additional-showing-time \"0\" \r\n    'sound-source \"real-audio\" \r\n    'speak-url-prefix \"../../speak/\"\r\n  'exercise-model \"none\"   \r\n  'mouse-advancement \"double-press\" \r\n  'word-index \"true\"  \r\n  'apply-css-styling \"false\"\r\n  'news-flash-string  \"\"  \r\n  'news-flash-level   \"2\"\r\n  'quiz-support \"false\"   \r\n  'verbosity-level \"1\"\r\n )\r\n) As of now, there is no easy way to make all the pieces of a multi lecture material. It is probably easiest first to initiate a single lecture material, and to create the missing pieces (as described above) manually.")) ((section-id "overall-org") (kind "manual-section") (section-title "Overall directory organization") (section-body "We start with a description of the overall organization of a set of lecture notes. Here follows the subdirectory structure of the directory with LENO lecture notes: notes\n  html\n    graphics\n      small\n    images\n    javascript\n    applets\n    external-html\n  graphics\n    small\n  images\n  includes\n  internal\n  stylesheets All of the names above are directory names. The notes directory contains the laml files (one laml file per chapter in the notes), the Scheme prefix and Scheme suffix files, and other source related files. Your are in control of the real name of this directory. When LENO is executed, an HTML file per lecture is placed in the notes directory. The html directory contains all the generated html files, and as can be seen, it contains a number of sub-directories. This organization is handy, because you can zip the html directory in order to obtain a self-contained set of information at HTML level. In other words, the contents of the html directory is enough to use the material in an Internet browser. The javascript directory contains a tiny amount of javascript stuff used by Leno. When you process a LENO file the javascript directory is populated automatically. It is possible to organize that the html directory is placed outside the notes directory. In order to do that you should define the source-destination-delta attribute of the leno-front-matters clause. This attributes defines the path 'difference' between the note source directory and the HTML destination directory. In the default case, the value of this attribute is \"html/\" . The notes/graphics directory contains gif, jpg, or png files for all the figures of the notes. The author of the notes is responsible for the population of this directory, as well as the subdirectory called small. If, for instance, f.gif is a file in html/graphics, f.fig must in addition be found in the directory html/graphics/small.  The idea is to reduce the figure in f.gif, and to place the reduced figure in the small directory. This turns out to be necessary, because most browsers makes very rough and poor reductions of pictures. The images directory contains note-specific icons that are used throughout the LENO systems. In most situations, this directory is empty (or it contains only the logo.gif image). Location hint icons, as described in the documentation of the function cross-reference-location-hints, serve as examples. The note-specific icons do not include the graphical illustrations nor the LENO icons. When you run LENO (thus generating the HTML version of the slides etc) the relevant image icons are copied from the notes/images directory to the html/images directory. Therefore we do not need to copy the images into this directory on beforehand. In the applets directory you should place java class files with applets. The directory external-html is intended to contain html files, which are considered an integrated part of a set of lecture notes, but being outside the LAML domain. In other words, here you can put html files, which somehow are relevant for the lecture notes. The internal directory contains helping files in Lisp format with extensions  aux, crs, exc, spk, lsp, and idx.  Most users of LENO do not need to care about these files. They are generated when a lecture on a LAML file is processsed. The aux file contains the name of the lecture together with an 'record' for each page in the lecture. The crs file contains information about all cross references found in a lecture. The exc file contains information about all the exercises of a lecture. lsp files contains a complete representation of the slides in a list representation. spk files contains information about show-and-speak details (if applied). And finally, an idx file contains all contributions to the index file from a given section. The includes directory can be used to material which is included (copied into) the notes. In other words, the material in the include directory is source material, which is addressed from the LAML note files. Such included material can also come from other places in your file system. The stylesheets directory contains note-specific CSS stylesheets. If you want to affect the appearance of your LENO slides you can organize your CSS files in this directory."))

This facility provides for an automatically progressing lecture with the lecturer's speaker sound. It is rather difficult to arrange for show and speak functionality in LENO. The information below will give you a help in the right direction, but it is probably not complete, nor totally up-to-date. The LENO clauses related to the facility is described elsewhere. Here we will focus on the practical procedure for recording and arranging the sound clips in relation to a LENO material. At the overall level, we can observe that the show and speak facility is based on the following: To each note page there is one or more corresponding sound clips On each note page we specify the sequencing and timing of the sound clips using a show-and-speak clause The sound clips are brought to the appropriate sound files by means of a LENO utility tool, found in the xml-in-laml LENO source program directory's util branch. A number of leno-front-matters attributes control the show and speak facility, most important the one called show-and-speak.  These are all attributes in the  leno-front-matters  element. The practical procedure for making and arranging a set of sound files is the following: Specify the sounds in the leno source, using  (show-and-speak ...)  clauses Be sure that the attributes show-and-speak is set to true. Process the lecture with the variable  show-and-speak-recording?  set to #t. Set in post-notes.scm. This will cause the numbers of the source sound files to appear in the annotated slide view. Using this information it is easy to find out where to locate a given sound clip. Record the sounds, on files 1.wav, 2.wav, etc. in a subdirectory of the sound dir.  We recommend to organize the sounds outside the note source directory, because they are too voluminous. Move the sound files from its subdirectory up one level to the sound directory. During the moving, the files should be renamed appropriately. The mentioned utility program does this, based on the information in the internal -.spk file. Process the leno LAML source file again. In this processing, be sure to set  show-and-speak-recording?  to false - #f. As another practical information, the processing of a LENO laml file with show-and-speak clauses (and with show-and-speak? set to #t) generates a -.spk file in the internal directory. This file holds all the bookkeeping information about the show-and-speak clauses in a LENO laml file.")))

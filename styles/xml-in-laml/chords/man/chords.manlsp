(((title . "The LAML Chords Reference Manual") (author . "Kurt N\370rmark normark@cs.auc.dk") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science Aalborg University Denmark") (abstract . "This is the manual of the LAML chords song format, which is based on a simple XML DTD. In this format\n                it is possible to carry out simple chords markup of a song text. This includes chord decorations and\n                and chord inversions (by means of a given bass note).  The song document is an XML-in-LAML\n                document. In other words, the song source complies with an XML DTD, but it is written as a Scheme/Lisp\n                expression, which uses mirror functions that correspond to the XML elements of the chords.dtd. The song format is supported by a few Emacs commands, which make it convenient and flexible to author\n                an LAML song text via the Emacs text editor. One of these, M-x make-chords, creates the initial chords file, with the overall markup. A number of specialized embedding commands, M-x embed-in-chord (bound to C-x  C-e ), M-x x-embed-in-chord (bound to C-x C-x ), M-x b-embed-in-chord (bound to C-x C-b ), and M-x x-b-embed-in-chord (bound to C-x B ) make it handy to embed a word or phrase in a chord (with or without additional attributes). As a slightly advanced feature, the LAML chords processor is able to transpose a song, via use of\n               the transpose attribute of the song-front-matters element. The transposition also affects the bass note of chord inversions. It is also possible to use the font-size attribute to adjust the font size. You can  use this attribute to ensure that a song text fits a single page. You\n               can also adjust the indentation to fit your preferences via use of the indentation attribute. Finally, you can color the chords by using the chord-color attribute. It may be useful to consult the LAML chords examples. Seen from the context of LAML, the LAML Chords facility serves as a simple example of my personal\n               use of LAML within the area music notation (keyboard/MIDI). For chord presentation purposes, we support a number of variations. See the attributes h-hame, cs-or-db, ds-or-eb, fs-or-gb, gs-or-ab, and as-or-hb of the song-front-matters element.")

The names of basic chords mirror functions in Scheme are c, cs, d, eb, e, f, fs, g, gs, a, hb, h. These are documented above. These functions are, of course, supported by Emacs. The s in cs means 'sharp' (one half tone up), and the b in hb means flat (one half tone down). In addition, the following alternative chord names are supported: db (= cs), ds (= eb), gb (= fs), ab (= gs), and as (= hb). A number of additional, named mirror functions are derived automatically by the Chords Scheme software. These are CHORD-NAMEm for minor chords, CHORD-NAME7 for the seventh variation, CHORD-NAME6 for the sixth variation, and CHORD-NAMEm7 for the seventh minor variation, where CHORD-NAME is one of c, db, cs, d, ds, eb, e, f, gb, fs, g, ab, gs, a, as, hb, and h. Emacs supports all these names via completion in the chords embedding editing commands, see below. Many of these chord names translate to use of the x attribute with the the attribute value \"m\", \"6\", or \"7\". The following chord-embedding Emacs editing commands are supported: M-x embed-in-chord (C-x C-e):  Basic chord embedding. M-x x-embed-in-chord (C-x C-x):  Adds an empty x attribute name-value pair. M-x b-embed-in-chord (C-x C-b):  Adds an empty b attribute name-value pair. M-x x-b-embed-in-chord (C-x B):  Adds empty x and b attribute name-value pairs. These editing commands prompt for chord names, and they use completions to avoid simple typos. In addition to the chord embedding commands, the following chord-related editing command is supported: M-x make-chords:  This command is embeds the content of an entire buffer in a LAML chord XML-in-LAML template, and it enters the Chords Emacs mode.")))

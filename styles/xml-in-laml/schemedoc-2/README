Schemedoc-2 represents a restructuring of the software behind SchemeDoc.

SITUATION BEFORE (pre-version 27):
There were three parts involved:

  1. styles/xml-in-laml/manual/manual.scm:
     The XML-in-LAML front-end of SchemeDoc.

  2. styles/manual/manual-kernel.scm:
     The older and original (not XML-in-LAML) backend of SchemeDoc.
     Kept for backward compatibility

  3. tools/schemedoc/schemedoc.scm:
     The important piece of software that extracts API information
     from a Scheme source file.

SITUATION NOW (version 27 and subsequent versions):

  1. styles/xml-in-laml/schemedoc-2/schemedoc.scm
     Represents both front-end and back-end (1+2 from above).
     We are not any longer backward compatible with the very early (original) SchemeDoc format.
     We use the directory name schemedoc-2 to signal the same organization and quality
     as elucidator-2, and hopefully the forthcoming leno-2.

  2. tools/schemedoc/schemedoc-extractor.scm:
     The same as 3 from above, just renamed.
     It is practical to keep this part of the system in a separate library, because
     the Scheme Elucidator makes use of it.

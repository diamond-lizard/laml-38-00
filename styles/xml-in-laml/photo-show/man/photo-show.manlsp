(((title . "Reference Manual of LAML Photo Show Tool") (author . "Kurt N\370rmark    normark@cs.aau.dk") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark.") (abstract . "This is the reference manual of the LAML Photo Show tool. This tool allows you to create a set of HTML files embedded\r\n           in a directory with photos (jpg files). The HTML files that surround the images provides for smooth navigation, and\r\n           it provides nice overviews of your pictures, all made by HTML files which can be shown in any Internet browser. Some\r\n           help to photo management is also provided.  This tool is based on XML-in-LAML. A few features of this tool depend on MzScheme.\r\n           Some of the more advanced features depend on ImageMagick. In order (in order to make the MzScheme system procedure available) to initiate ImageMatick from MzScheme put (require (lib \"process.ss\")) into your .laml file. Seen from the context of LAML, the LAML Photo Show facility serves as a simple example of my personal use of LAML within the area of\r\n           batch photo management.")

Each film is a directory itself. Films cannot be nested into each other; Thus the films obey a flat organization within the top-level photo show directory. There may, however, be subdirs of the photo show directory with other photo shows directories (recursive orgnization). As of now, no linking is provided to these. The directory corresponding to a film contains a flat list of jpg files, with arbitrary names. To use the LAML photo show generator you should put a LAML file side-by-side with the photos, which describes the properties of the photo show, as related to the current film. This reference manual documents how this LAML is made. To make things easy, use the Emacs command M-x make-laml-photo-show (found in 'Tools>LAML>Make new photo show...') for this. Thus, the typical directory and file organization is like the following: process-all-films.laml\r\nindex.html\r\nFilm1\r\n  1.jpg\r\n  2.jpg\r\n  3.jpg\r\n  make-show.laml\r\n  index.html\r\n  html\r\n   1.html\r\n   ...\r\n  internal\r\n   film-description-entry.lsp\r\n   photo-ast.lsp\r\n   photo-list\r\nFilm2\r\n  1.jpg\r\n  2.jpg\r\n  3.jpg\r\n  index.html\r\n  make-show.laml\r\n  html\r\n   1.html\r\n   ...\r\n  internal\r\n   film-description-entry.lsp\r\n   photo-ast.lsp\r\n   photo-list\r\nFilm3\r\n  4.jpg\r\n  5.jpg\r\n  6.jpg\r\n  index.html\r\n  make-show.laml\r\n  html\r\n   1.html\r\n   ...\r\n  internal\r\n   film-description-entry.lsp\r\n   photo-ast.lsp\r\n   photo-list You are supposed to make to top level directory and the film directories. The directory names are arbitrary. The jpg files are created by the software that transfers photos from your digital camera. You write the make-show.laml files with your text editor - Emacs, for instance. The name of this file is arbitrary, but you should use the laml extension. The LAML photo show generator makes the remaining files and directories. Notice the file process-all-films.laml in the root which, when processed, regenerates the photo shows for all (already once processed) films; This laml file is made automatically the first to you process one of the films. If you delete it a new process-all-films.laml will appear the next time you have processed a film.  You can use the LAML photo show generator to make collections of photos from different directories, without copying any photo. To do so, make a film directory without jpg files, and address individual photos in arbitrary films from there. LAML makes it easy to do so, because you can copy the necessary photo clauses from your browser into the text editor. The names of the photos are linked to the appropriate photo clauses. If some existing film is not supposed to make it into the index, place a file named 'exclude' side by side with the jpg files."))

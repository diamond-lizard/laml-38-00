It is possible to define and process the entire course-plan structure
monolithically.

  (course-plan

   (lecture-intro 
     "intro")
  
   (course-info
     ...
  
     (time-list
       ...
     )
  
     (lecture-list
       ...
     )
  
  
     (subject-list
      ...
     )
  
  
     (index-links
       ...
     )
    
     (bottom-links
       ....
     )
   )

   (lecture-plan-list
     (lecture-plan 'lecture-id "xxx" 'subject-id "sss"
      (literature ...)
      (exercises ...)
      (misc ...))

     ...
   )
   
  )



It is also possible to process the course intro and the individual lecture plans
individually:

  (course-plan
   
    (course-info
     'make-overview-pages "true" 
     ; include rest
    )
    
    (course-intro 
       "intro")
      
  )

And similary for a given lecture-plan (ugeseddel):

  (course-plan
   
    (course-info
     'make-overview-pages "false" 
     ; include rest
    )
    
    (lecture-plan 'lecture-id "xxx" 'subject-id "sss"
      ...
    )
      
  )


With this solution there will be a common-course-info file with 
a list of informations to include - like the current common front matters
stuff of LENO lectures.

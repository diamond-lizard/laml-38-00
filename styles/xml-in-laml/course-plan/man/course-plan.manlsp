(((title . "Reference Manual of the Course Plan System") (author . "Kurt N\370rmark") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science Aalborg University Denmark") (abstract . "The Course Plan System is used to make a course home page.\n               The input description to the system is an XML-in-LAML description of the course properties.\n               The output is a set of HTML pages. Among these is an LAML calendar. The generated\n               course home pages make use of frames. More specifically, the leftmost frame in the browser\n               is used as an overview frame of all constituents of a course home page. Amonge these are \n               pages that describe the individual lectures.\n                 This manual is derived from the XML Course Plan DTD. This manual reflects this DTD in a very direct way, by\n                documenting the XML element mirror functions and their attributes.  There exists an example course home page in the LAML examples directory. For a 'real life example' see\n              the Programming Paradigm home page and the C Programming home page both of which are generated by the system.")

It consists of three levels of descriptions. First, the subjects taught in the course are supposed to be the most stable - and most long living - informations pertaining to the course. A catalogue of subjects are described in the subject-list. Notice that an arbitrary set of subjects may be described. Typically, a teacher may have some subjects on stock for possible future use. It is, however, also possible to inline the subject information (in terms of a description element, a title attribute and a possible href attribute) in a lecture element. Second, when it comes to the actual planning of the course, before the semester starts, the lecture entries in the lecture-list are made. Each lecture has its own id, and each lecture can refer to one of the subjects via the subject-id (in case the subject info is not inlined). The structuring of the lecture in plenum and exercises is also decided. Usually, this is fixed for all lectures, and a list of exercises-start, exercise-length, plenum-start, and plenum-length attributes may be factored out of the description. The temporal issues may be part of a lecture, using the time form. However, I usually make a separate time-list with time entries. Using this solution, time form i  corresponds to lecture form i. Using this solution it is most often easy to change the schedule of the course without affecting or involving the individual lecture descriptions. Third and finally, during the course the lecture-plan entries in the lecture-plan list are made. A lecture-plan entry refers to a lecture entry via a lecture-id. Properties such as literature and exercises are described as part of a lecture-plan entry. Notice that the attribute last-lecture-number of the course-info form controls the opening of links to concrete lecture plans. By processing a Course Plan all pages are regenerated, including all the separate lecture frame pages."))

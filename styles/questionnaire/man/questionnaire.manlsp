(abstract . " This is a LAML questionnaire style. It is based on the html4.0-loose libraries. The main function is questionnaire. Besides this function and its helping functions, a collection of useful quetionnaire functionality is collected in this style; Some of these are used in the accompanying cgi programs. A submitted questionnaire can be self-contained if you want; It means that the questions and possible answers are submitted too via hidden lines. The cgi programs rely on self contained submissions. If a questions is identified with 'ID, the field 'IDquestion' denotes the formulation of the question. In case of multi-choice-question, single-choice-question, and rating-question the questions themselves are submitted via hidden input lines with the answering possibilities submitted as 'IDanswers' in a particular encoding.<p> The cgi programs in cgi-support (a subdirectory of the containing directory - not part of the LAML distribution) holds a number of accompanying cgi programs which can accept and display submissions. If you are interested in this part of the work, please contact normark@cs.auc.dk.<p> Important: Avoid the character '' in both questions, answers, and ids.<p> Please consult the <a href=\"../../../examples/questionnaire/index.html\">example questionnaire</a> for further information and insight.

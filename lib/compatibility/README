In this directory you will find the so-called compatibility
files, which implement non-standard (non R4RS, non R5RS) functions that
are used in LAML.

Compatibility file naming convention:  <laml-platform>_<operating-system>_<scheme-system>.scm

In case <laml-platform> or <operating-system> is 'star' in the name of
a compatibility file: The compatibility file is generic for all
platforms or operating system.

The windows_win2000_mzscheme.scm, windows_nt40_mzscheme.scm, windows_win95_mzscheme.scm, 
and windows_win98_mzscheme.scm are identical.


The sorting directory contains Aubrey Jaffer's sort.scm library, which is
recommended if your favorite Scheme system does not support a list sorting 
function. Usage:

1. Include sorting/sort.scm in the compatibility file.
2. (define sort-list sort:sort)

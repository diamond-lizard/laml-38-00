;;;; .title Reference Manual of the MzScheme LAML compatibility libray.
;;;; MzScheme specific stuff to be loaded for compatibility. 
;;;; This file implements each of the necessary non-R5RS functions mentioned in the
;;;; root documentation of the LAML system. Notice that some of the non-standard Scheme functions used
;;;; in LAML already happens to exist in MzScheme. These are 
;;;; file-exists?, delete-file, copy-file, and directory-exists?
;;;; Therefore, these functions need not to be provided in this compatibility library.

;;; The functions in this section are general purpose functions which happen
;;; not to be in the Scheme standard (R5RS).

;; Sort list using the comparison predicate

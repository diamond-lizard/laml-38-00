(((title . "LAML Compatibility Functions") (author . "Kurt Nørmark") (affiliation . "Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University") (abstract . "The LAML software relies on a number of functions, which are non-standard both in R4RS and\n            R5RS. You can think of these as functions that extend R4RS/R5RS a little bit to fill the gap\n            between the LAML code base and the Scheme standard. We support a set of compatibility files for different platforms, operating systems,\n            and Scheme systems in the directory lib/compatibility/ of the LAML distribution. The relevant compatibility\n            file is loaded automatically by laml.scm, based on the configuration file that\n            you elaborated as part of LAML installation process. It is important to understand that some of the compatibility functions, described in this manual, are alread implemented by some Scheme systems.\n            If that is the case, it is not necessary to implement them in the LAML compatility file.

;;;; This library supports buffered input stream. A buffered input stream is convenient for various kinds of parsing tasks. <p>
;;;; It is assumed that the variable ip references an open input port, or a string. The assignment of ip must be done
;;;; exernally to this library, and after the library is loaded. If ip references an open input stream (made by the Scheme function
;;;; open-input-file, for instance) input is read from that port. If ip is string, the variable pstring-ip-pointer is used as a pointer
;;;; into the string.<p>
;;;; The functions in section one are generic, low-level reading functions that either read from the open input port, or from a string (at the location 
;;;; determined by the variable pstring-ip-pointer). The functions in section two are the basic reading and peeking functions. 
;;;; In section three a number of convenient collection and skipping functions
;;;; are provided for.<p>
;;;; This library has been developed as part of an SGML/XML Document Type Definition (DTD) parser, but
;;;; it is useful in many other parsing situations.
;;;; There exists <a href="http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/scheme/tools/dtd-parser/doc/html/index.html">som early internal documentation</a>
;;;; of the DTD parser (on the www.cs.auc.dk site)
;;;; and as such also of some aspects of the functions in this library.<p>
;;;; In earlier versions of LAML, this library was called 'the text collection and skipping library'.

;;; Look ahead buffer and queue.
;;; The functions in this section manipulates a look ahead queue, which is in between the input port ip
;;; and the applications. Via this buffer it is possible to implement look ahead in the input port.<p>
;;; Imagine an input buffer of (actual) size n:
;;; <pre>    c1 c2 c3 ... cn </pre>
;;; When characters are read from the input stream, they enter to the right (the peek end).
;;; When characters are read by an application they are taken from the left (the read end).
;;; Thus, cn is the last character read from the input port (or from the input string); This is done by peek-a-char.
;;; c1 is the next char to leave the buffer, and to be read by the client application; This will be done by read-a-char.<p>
;;;
;;; A few words about terminology in relation to R4RS or R5RS. The Scheme procedure read-char corresponds roughtly to read-a-char;
;;; The former always reads a character from an input port; The latter reads from an input stream via the buffer; 
;;; Only if the buffer is empty, a character is read from the port or string.
;;; The proper Scheme function peek-char returns the next char from the input port, without updating the 'input pointer'.
;;; The function peek-a-char of this library is different, because it reads a character from the file and puts it into the buffer.
;;; This use of terminology is unfortunate, and it may be confusing for some readers.

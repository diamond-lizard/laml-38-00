This directory contains manual pages of the Scheme libraries in ../

You can re-process the manual files via use of the laml files in this
directory. In order to do so, however, you must define the function
(kn-manual-settings) in your .laml file. Here is my implementation:

(define (kn-manual-settings)
  (list
    (manual-author "Kurt Nørmark" "normark@cs.auc.dk" )
    (manual-affiliation "Department of Computer Science" "Aalborg University" "Denmark")
    'css-prestylesheet "compact"
    'css-stylesheet "original"
    'css-stylesheet-copying "true"
  ))

The manlsp files are internal files generated by the SchemeDoc manual
facility. They contain an internal representation of the manuals. The
Scheme Elucidator uses this information.

You can change the CSS styling of the manuals by executing one of the
LAML scripts in

   css-stylesheets/change-manual-stylesheet/

of your LAML distribution.

(abstract . " This library supports buffered input stream. A buffered input stream is convenient for various kinds of parsing tasks. <p> It is assumed that the variable ip references an open input port, or a string. The assignment of ip must be done exernally to this library, and after the library is loaded. If ip references an open input stream (made by the Scheme function open-input-file, for instance) input is read from that port. If ip is string, the variable pstring-ip-pointer is used as a pointer into the string.<p> The functions in section one are generic, low-level reading functions that either read from the open input port, or from a string (at the location  determined by the variable pstring-ip-pointer). The functions in section two are the basic reading and peeking functions.  In section three a number of convenient collection and skipping functions are provided for.<p> This library has been developed as part of an SGML/XML Document Type Definition (DTD) parser, but it is useful in many other parsing situations. There exists <a href=\"http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/scheme/tools/dtd-parser/doc/html/index.html\">som early internal documentation</a> of the DTD parser (on the www.cs.auc.dk site) and as such also of some aspects of the functions in this library.<p> In earlier versions of LAML, this library was called 'the text collection and skipping library'.

When characters are read by an application they are taken from the left (the read end). Thus, cn is the last character read from the input port (or from the input string); This is done by peek-a-char. c1 is the next char to leave the buffer, and to be read by the client application; This will be done by read-a-char.<p> A few words about terminology in relation to R4RS or R5RS. The Scheme procedure read-char corresponds roughtly to read-a-char; The former always reads a character from an input port; The latter reads from an input stream via the buffer; Only if the buffer is empty, a character is read from the port or string. The proper Scheme function peek-char returns the next char from the input port, without updating the 'input pointer'. The function peek-a-char of this library is different, because it reads a character from the file and puts it into the buffer. This use of terminology is unfortunate, and it may be confusing for some readers."))

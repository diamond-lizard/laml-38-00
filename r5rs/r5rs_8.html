<P>
This chapter describes Scheme's built-in procedures.  The initial (or
"top level") Scheme environment starts out with a number of variables
bound to locations containing useful values, most of which are primitive
procedures that manipulate data.  For example, the variable <SAMP>`abs'</SAMP> is
bound to (a location initially containing) a procedure of one argument
that computes the absolute value of a number, and the variable <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
is bound to a procedure that computes sums.  Built-in procedures that
can easily be written in terms of other built-in procedures are identified as
"library procedures".


<P>
A program may use a top-level definition to bind any variable.  It may
subsequently alter any such binding by an assignment (see see section <A HREF="r5rs_6.html#SEC31">4.1.6 Assignments</A>).
These operations do not modify the behavior of Scheme's built-in
procedures.  Altering any top-level binding that has not been introduced by a
definition has an unspecified effect on the behavior of the built-in procedures.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>


<P>
A <EM>predicate</EM> is a procedure that always returns a boolean
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
value (<TT>#t</TT> or <TT>#f</TT>).  An <EM>equivalence predicate</EM> is
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
the computational analogue of a mathematical equivalence relation (it is
symmetric, reflexive, and transitive).  Of the equivalence predicates
described in this section, <SAMP>`eq?'</SAMP> is the finest or most
discriminating, and <SAMP>`equal?'</SAMP> is the coarsest.  <SAMP>`Eqv?'</SAMP> is
slightly less discriminating than <SAMP>`eq?'</SAMP>.

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>eqv?</B> <I>obj1 obj2</I>

<P>
The <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> procedure defines a useful equivalence relation on objects.
Briefly, it returns <TT>#t</TT> if <VAR>obj1</VAR> and <VAR>obj2</VAR> should
normally be regarded as the same object.  This relation is left slightly
open to interpretation, but the following partial specification of
<SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> holds for all implementations of Scheme.


<P>
The <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> procedure returns <TT>#t</TT> if:



<UL>

<LI>

<VAR>obj1</VAR> and <VAR>obj2</VAR> are both <TT>#t</TT> or both <TT>#f</TT>.

<LI>

<VAR>obj1</VAR> and <VAR>obj2</VAR> are both symbols and

<P>
The following examples illustrate cases in which the above rules do
not fully specify the behavior of <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>.  All that can be said
about such cases is that the value returned by <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> must be a
boolean.



<PRE>
<TT>(eqv? "" "")                           ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>

      (lambda (y) y))                  ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
The next set of examples shows the use of <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> with procedures
that have local state.  <SAMP>`Gen-counter'</SAMP> must return a distinct
procedure every time, since each procedure has its own internal counter.
<SAMP>`Gen-loser'</SAMP>, however, returns equivalent procedures each time, since
the local state does not affect the value or side effects of the
procedures.



<PRE>

  (lambda ()
    (let ((n 0))
      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) n))))

      (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) 27))))

  (eqv? f g))
                                       ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>

(letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'f 'both)))
         (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'g 'both))))

                                       ==&#62;  #f
</TT>
</PRE>

<P>
Since it is an error to modify constant objects (those returned by
literal expressions), implementations are permitted, though not
required, to share structure between constants where appropriate.  Thus
the value of <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> on constants is sometimes
implementation-dependent.



<PRE>
<TT>(eqv? '(a) '(a))                       ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>
(eqv? "a" "a")                         ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>
(eqv? '(b) (cdr '(a b)))               ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>

</TT>
</PRE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM> 
The above definition of <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> allows implementations latitude in
their treatment of procedures and literals:  implementations are free
either to detect or to fail to detect that two procedures or two literals
are equivalent to each other, and can decide whether or not to
merge representations of equivalent objects by using the same pointer or
bit pattern to represent both.

<P>
<SAMP>`Eq?'</SAMP> is similar to <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> except that in some cases it is
capable of discerning distinctions finer than those detectable by
<SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>.


<P>
<SAMP>`Eq?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> are guaranteed to have the same
behavior on symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, procedures,
and non-empty
strings and vectors.  <SAMP>`Eq?'</SAMP>'s behavior on numbers and characters is
implementation-dependent, but it will always return either true or
false, and will return true only when <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> would also return
true.  <SAMP>`Eq?'</SAMP> may also behave differently from <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> on empty
vectors and empty strings.

<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM> It will usually be possible to implement <SAMP>`eq?'</SAMP> much
more efficiently than <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>, for example, as a simple pointer
comparison instead of as some more complicated operation.  One reason is
that it may not be possible to compute <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP> of two numbers in
constant time, whereas <SAMP>`eq?'</SAMP> implemented as pointer comparison will
always finish in constant time.  <SAMP>`Eq?'</SAMP> may be used like <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>
in applications using procedures to implement objects with state since
it obeys the same constraints as <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>.

the same.  <SAMP>`Equal?'</SAMP> may fail to terminate if its arguments are

<P>
Numerical computation has traditionally been neglected by the Lisp
community.  Until Common Lisp there was no carefully thought out
strategy for organizing numerical computation, and with the exception of
the MacLisp system <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB20">[Pitman83]</A> little effort was made to
execute numerical code efficiently.  This report recognizes the excellent work
of the Common Lisp committee and accepts many of their recommendations.
In some ways this report simplifies and generalizes their proposals in a manner
consistent with the purposes of Scheme.


<P>
It is important to distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the
Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations
used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers.
This report uses the types <I>number</I>, <I>complex</I>, <I>real</I>,
<I>rational</I>, and <I>integer</I> to refer to both mathematical numbers
and Scheme numbers.  Machine representations such as fixed point and
floating point are referred to by names such as <I>fixnum</I> and
<I>flonum</I>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="r5rs_toc.html#TOC51">6.2.1 Numerical types</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>


<P>
Mathematically, numbers may be arranged into a tower of subtypes
in which each level is a subset of the level above it:



<PRE>
         number 
          complex 
          real 
          rational 
          integer 
</PRE>

<P>
For example, 3 is an integer.  Therefore 3 is also a rational,
a real, and a complex.  The same is true of the Scheme numbers
that model 3.  For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the
predicates <CODE>number?</CODE>, <CODE>complex?</CODE>, <CODE>real?</CODE>, <CODE>rational?</CODE>,
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
and <CODE>integer?</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>


<P>
There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its
representation inside a computer.  Although most implementations of
Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these
different representations denote the same integer.


<P>
Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as
independent of their representation as possible.  Although an implementation
of Scheme may use fixnum, flonum, and perhaps other representations for
numbers, this should not be apparent to a casual programmer writing
simple programs.


<P>
It is necessary, however, to distinguish between numbers that are
represented exactly and those that may not be.  For example, indexes
into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial
coefficients in a symbolic algebra system.  On the other hand, the
results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers
may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations.
In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are
required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.
This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.




<H3><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="r5rs_toc.html#TOC52">6.2.2 Exactness</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>


<P>
 
Scheme numbers are either <I>exact</I> or <I>inexact</I>.  A number is
exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from
exact numbers using only exact operations.  A number is
inexact if it was written as an inexact constant,
if it was
derived using inexact ingredients, or if it was derived using
inexact operations. Thus inexactness is a contagious
property of a number.


<P>
If two implementations produce exact results for a
computation that did not involve inexact intermediate results,
the two ultimate results will be mathematically equivalent.  This is
generally not true of computations involving inexact numbers
since approximate methods such as floating point arithmetic may be used,
but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as close as
practical to the mathematically ideal result.


<P>
Rational operations such as <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> should always produce
exact results when given exact arguments.
If the operation is unable to produce an exact result,
then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction
or it may silently coerce its
result to an inexact value.
See section <A HREF="r5rs_8.html#SEC53">6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</A>.


<P>
With the exception of <CODE>inexact-&#62;exact</CODE>, the operations described in
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
this section must generally return inexact results when given any inexact
arguments.  An operation may, however, return an exact result if it can
prove that the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its
arguments.  For example, multiplication of any number by an exact zero
may produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is
inexact.




<H3><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="r5rs_toc.html#TOC53">6.2.3 Implementation restrictions</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>


<P>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>


<P>
Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole
tower of subtypes given in section <A HREF="r5rs_8.html#SEC51">6.2.1 Numerical types</A>,
but they must implement a coherent subset consistent with both the
purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real
may still be quite useful.


<P>
Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of
any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  The supported
range for exact numbers of any type may be different from the
supported range for inexact numbers of that type.  For example,
an implementation that uses flonums to represent all its
inexact real numbers may
support a practically unbounded range of exact integers
and rationals
while limiting the range of inexact reals (and therefore
the range of inexact integers and rationals)
to the dynamic range of the flonum format.
Furthermore
the gaps between the representable inexact integers and
rationals are
likely to be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this
range are approached.


<P>
An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers
throughout the range of numbers that may be used for indexes of
lists, vectors, and strings or that may result from computing the length of a
list, vector, or string.  The <CODE>length</CODE>, <CODE>vector-length</CODE>,
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
and <CODE>string-length</CODE> procedures must return an exact
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
integer, and it is an error to use anything but an exact integer as an
index.  Furthermore any integer constant within the index range, if
expressed by an exact integer syntax, will indeed be read as an exact
integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that may apply
outside this range.  Finally, the procedures listed below will always
return an exact integer result provided all their arguments are exact integers
and the mathematically expected result is representable as an exact integer
within the implementation:



<PRE>

+            -             *
quotient     remainder     modulo
max          min           abs
numerator    denominator   gcd
lcm          floor         ceiling
truncate     round         rationalize
expt

</PRE>

<P>
Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to support
exact integers and exact rationals of
practically unlimited size and precision, and to implement the
above procedures and the <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> procedure in
such a way that they always return exact results when given exact
arguments.  If one of these procedures is unable to deliver an exact
result when given exact arguments, then it may either report a
violation of an
implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an
inexact number.  Such a coercion may cause an error later.


<P>
An implementation may use floating point and other approximate 
representation strategies for inexact numbers.


<P>
This report recommends, but does not require, that the IEEE 32-bit
and 64-bit floating point standards be followed by implementations that use
flonum representations, and that implementations using
other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable
using these floating point standards <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB12">[IEEE]</A>.


<P>
In particular, implementations that use flonum representations
must follow these rules: A flonum result
must be represented with at least as much precision as is used to express any of
the inexact arguments to that operation.  It is desirable (but not required) for
potentially inexact operations such as <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>, when applied to exact
arguments, to produce exact answers whenever possible (for example the
square root of an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2).
If, however, an
exact number is operated upon so as to produce an inexact result
(as by <SAMP>`sqrt'</SAMP>), and if the result is represented as a flonum, then
the most precise flonum format available must be used; but if the result
is represented in some other way then the representation must have at least as
much precision as the most precise flonum format available.


<P>
Although Scheme allows a variety of written
notations for
numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of them.
For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real
need not support the rectangular and polar notations for complex
numbers.  If an implementation encounters an exact numerical constant that
it cannot represent as an exact number, then it may either report a
violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the
constant by an inexact number.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>


<P>
The syntax of the written representations for numbers is described formally in
section <A HREF="r5rs_9.html#SEC73">7.1.1 Lexical structure</A>.  Note that case is not significant in numerical
constants.


<P>
A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or
hexadecimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix prefixes are <SAMP>`#b'</SAMP> (binary), <SAMP>`#o'</SAMP> (octal), <SAMP>`#d'</SAMP> (decimal), and <SAMP>`#x'</SAMP> (hexadecimal).  With
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.


<P>
A
numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or
inexact by a prefix.  The prefixes are <SAMP>`#e'</SAMP>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
for exact, and <SAMP>`#i'</SAMP> for inexact.  An exactness
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is used.  If
the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the
constant may be either inexact or exact.  It is
inexact if it contains a decimal point, an
exponent, or a "#" character in the place of a digit,
otherwise it is exact.


<P>
In systems with inexact numbers
of varying precisions it may be useful to specify
the precision of a constant.  For this purpose, numerical constants
may be written with an exponent marker that indicates the
desired precision of the inexact
representation.  The letters <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`l'</SAMP> specify the use of <VAR>short</VAR>, <VAR>single</VAR>,
<VAR>double</VAR>, and <VAR>long</VAR> precision, respectively.  (When fewer
than four internal
inexact
representations exist, the four size
specifications are mapped onto those available.  For example, an
implementation with two internal representations may map short and
single together and long and double together.)  In addition, the
exponent marker <SAMP>`e'</SAMP> specifies the default precision for the
implementation.  The default precision has at least as much precision
as <VAR>double</VAR>, but
implementations may wish to allow this default to be set by the user.

The reader is referred to section <A HREF="r5rs_3.html#SEC11">1.3.3 Entry format</A> for a summary

arguments to numerical routines.


<P>
The examples used in this section assume that any numerical constant written
using an exact notation is indeed represented as an exact
number.  Some examples also assume that certain numerical constants written
using an inexact notation can be represented without loss of
accuracy; the inexact constants were chosen so that this is
likely to be true in implementations that use flonums to represent
inexact numbers.

These numerical type predicates can be applied to any kind of
argument, including non-numbers.  They return <TT>#t</TT> if the object is
of the named type, and otherwise they return <TT>#f</TT>.
In general, if a type predicate is true of a number then all higher
type predicates are also true of that number.  Consequently, if a type
predicate is false of a number, then all lower type predicates are
also false of that number.

every other rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies
between 2/7 and 3/5).  Note that 0 = 0/1 is the simplest rational of
all.

<P>
In general, the mathematical functions log, arcsine, arccosine, and
arctangent are multiply defined.
The value of log z is defined to be the one whose imaginary
part lies in the range from -pi (exclusive) to pi (inclusive).
log 0 is undefined.
With log defined this way, the values of sin^-1 z, cos^-1 z,
and tan^-1 z are according to the following formulae:


<P>
sin^-1 z = -i log (i z + sqrt1 - z^2)


<P>
cos^-1 z = pi / 2 - sin^-1 z

tan^-1 z = (log (1 + i z) - log (1 - i z)) / (2 i)

matters, though, are the objects that the Scheme conditional expressions
(<SAMP>`if'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`cond'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`and'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`or'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`do'</SAMP>) treat as
true or false.  The phrase "a true value"
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>
(or sometimes just "true") means any object treated as true by the
conditional expressions, and the phrase "a false value" (or

Of all the standard Scheme values, only <TT>#f</TT>
counts as false in conditional expressions.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX306"></A>


<P>
A <EM>pair</EM> (sometimes called a <EM>dotted pair</EM>) is a
<A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
record structure with two fields called the car and cdr fields (for
historical reasons).  Pairs are created by the procedure <SAMP>`cons'</SAMP>.
The car and cdr fields are accessed by the procedures <SAMP>`car'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`cdr'</SAMP>.  The car and cdr fields are assigned by the procedures
<SAMP>`set-car!'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`set-cdr!'</SAMP>.


<P>
Pairs are used primarily to represent lists.  A list can
be defined recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose
<A NAME="IDX309"></A>
cdr is a list.  More precisely, the set of lists is defined as the smallest
set <VAR>X</VAR> such that



<UL>

<LI>

The empty list is in <VAR>X</VAR>.
<LI>

If <VAR>list</VAR> is in <VAR>X</VAR>, then any pair whose cdr field contains
<VAR>list</VAR> is also in <VAR>X</VAR>.

</UL>

<P>
The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are the
elements of the list.  For example, a two-element list is a pair whose car
is the first element and whose cdr is a pair whose car is the second element
and whose cdr is the empty list.  The length of a list is the number of
elements, which is the same as the number of pairs.


<P>
The empty list is a special object of its own type
(it is not a pair); it has no elements and its length is zero.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>
The above definitions imply that all lists have finite length and are
terminated by the empty list.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The most general notation (external representation) for Scheme pairs is
the "dotted" notation <SAMP>`(<VAR>c1</VAR> . <VAR>c2</VAR>)'</SAMP> where
<VAR>c1</VAR> is the value of the car field and <VAR>c2</VAR> is the value of the
cdr field.  For example <SAMP>`(4 . 5)'</SAMP> is a pair whose car is 4 and whose
cdr is 5.  Note that <SAMP>`(4 . 5)'</SAMP> is the external representation of a
pair, not an expression that evaluates to a pair.


<P>
A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the elements of the
list are simply enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces.  The
empty list is written <TT>()</TT> .  For example,



<PRE>

(a b c d e)

</PRE>

<P>
and



<PRE>

(a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))

</PRE>

<P>
are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.


<P>
A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an
<EM>improper list</EM>.  Note that an improper list is not a list.
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
The list and dotted notations can be combined to represent
improper lists:



<PRE>

(a b c . d)

</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to



<PRE>

(a . (b . (c . d)))

</PRE>

<P>
Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored in the cdr
field.  When the <CODE>set-cdr!</CODE> procedure is used, an object can be a
<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
list one moment and not the next:



<PRE>

(define x (list 'a 'b 'c))
(define y x)
y                                      ==&#62;  (a b c)

(eqv? x y)                             ==&#62;  #t
y                                      ==&#62;  (a . 4)
(list? y)                              ==&#62;  #f

<H3><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="r5rs_toc.html#TOC60">6.3.3 Symbols</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX344"></A>


<P>
Symbols are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact that two
symbols are identical (in the sense of <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>) if and only if their
names are spelled the same way.  This is exactly the property needed to
represent identifiers in programs, and so most
<A NAME="IDX345"></A>
implementations of Scheme use them internally for that purpose.  Symbols
are useful for many other applications; for instance, they may be used
the way enumerated values are used in Pascal.


<P>
The rules for writing a symbol are exactly the same as the rules for
writing an identifier; see sections section <A HREF="r5rs_4.html#SEC15">2.1 Identifiers</A>
and section <A HREF="r5rs_9.html#SEC73">7.1.1 Lexical structure</A>.


<P>
It is guaranteed that any symbol that has been returned as part of
a literal expression, or read using the <SAMP>`read'</SAMP> procedure, and
subsequently written out using the <SAMP>`write'</SAMP> procedure, will read back
in as the identical symbol (in the sense of <SAMP>`eqv?'</SAMP>).  The
<SAMP>`string-&#62;symbol'</SAMP> procedure, however, can create symbols for
which this write/read invariance may not hold because their names
contain special characters or letters in the non-standard case.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>
Some implementations of Scheme have a feature known as "slashification"
in order to guarantee write/read invariance for all symbols, but
historically the most important use of this feature has been to
compensate for the lack of a string data type.


<P>
Some implementations also have "uninterned symbols", which
defeat write/read invariance even in implementations with slashification,
and also generate exceptions to the rule that two symbols are the same
if and only if their names are spelled the same.

(section see section <A HREF="r5rs_6.html#SEC27">4.1.2 Literal expressions</A>) or by a call to the <SAMP>`read'</SAMP> procedure,
and its name contains alphabetic characters, then the string returned
will contain characters in the implementation's preferred standard
case--some implementations will prefer upper case, others lower case.
If the symbol was returned by <SAMP>`string-&#62;symbol'</SAMP>, the case of
characters in the string returned will be the same as the case in the
string that was passed to <SAMP>`string-&#62;symbol'</SAMP>.  It is an error

<P>
<A NAME="IDX350"></A>


<P>
Characters are objects that represent printed characters such as
letters and digits.  
Characters are written using the notation #\&#60;character&#62;
or #\&#60;character name&#62;.
For example:


<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>#\a</TT>
<DD>

<DT><TT>#\A</TT>
<DD>
; upper case letter
<DT><TT>#\(</TT>
<DD>
; left parenthesis
<DT><TT>#\ </TT>
<DD>
; the space character
<DT><TT>#\space</TT>
<DD>
; the preferred way to write a space
<DT><TT>#\newline</TT>
<DD>
; the newline character
<DT>
<DD>
</DL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Case is significant in #\&#60;character&#62;, but not in
#\&#60;character name&#62;.  
                                                            
If &#60;character&#62; in
#\&#60;character&#62; is alphabetic, then the character
following &#60;character&#62; must be a delimiter character such as a
space or parenthesis.  This rule resolves the ambiguous case where, for
example, the sequence of characters "<TT>#\ space</TT>"
could be taken to be either a representation of the space character or a
representation of the character "<TT>#\ s</TT>" followed
by a representation of the symbol "<TT>pace</TT>."


<P>
Characters written in the #\ notation are self-evaluating.
That is, they do not have to be quoted in programs.  


<P>
Some of the procedures that operate on characters ignore the
difference between upper case and lower case.  The procedures that
ignore case have "<TT>-ci</TT>" (for "case
insensitive") embedded in their names.

<P>
These procedures impose a total ordering on the set of characters.  It
is guaranteed that under this ordering:



<UL>

<LI>

The upper case characters are in order.  For example, <SAMP>`(char&#60;? #\A #\B)'</SAMP> returns <TT>#t</TT>.
<LI>

The lower case characters are in order.  For example, <SAMP>`(char&#60;? #\a #\b)'</SAMP> returns <TT>#t</TT>.
<LI>

The digits are in order.  For example, <SAMP>`(char&#60;? #\0 #\9)'</SAMP> returns <TT>#t</TT>.
<LI>

Either all the digits precede all the upper case letters, or vice versa.
<LI>

Either all the digits precede all the lower case letters, or vice versa.

</UL>

Some implementations may generalize these procedures to take more than
two arguments, as with the corresponding numerical predicates.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX372"></A>


<P>
Strings are sequences of characters.  
Strings are written as sequences of characters enclosed within doublequotes
(<SAMP>`"'</SAMP>).  A doublequote can be written inside a string only by escaping
it with a backslash (\), as in



<PRE>

"The word \"recursion\" has many meanings."

</PRE>

<P>
A backslash can be written inside a string only by escaping it with another
backslash.  Scheme does not specify the effect of a backslash within a
string that is not followed by a doublequote or backslash.


<P>
A string constant may continue from one line to the next, but
the exact contents of such a string are unspecified.


<P>
The <EM>length</EM> of a string is the number of characters that it
contains.  This number is an exact, non-negative integer that is fixed when the
string is created.  The <EM>valid indexes</EM> of a string are the
<A NAME="IDX373"></A>
exact non-negative integers less than the length of the string.  The first
character of a string has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.


<P>
In phrases such as "the characters of <VAR>string</VAR> beginning with
index <VAR>start</VAR> and ending with index <VAR>end</VAR>," it is understood
that the index <VAR>start</VAR> is inclusive and the index <VAR>end</VAR> is
exclusive.  Thus if <VAR>start</VAR> and <VAR>end</VAR> are the same index, a null
substring is referred to, and if <VAR>start</VAR> is zero and <VAR>end</VAR> is
the length of <VAR>string</VAR>, then the entire string is referred to.


<P>
Some of the procedures that operate on strings ignore the
difference between upper and lower case.  The versions that ignore case
have "<SAMP>`-ci'</SAMP>" (for "case insensitive") embedded in their
names.

<H3><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="r5rs_toc.html#TOC63">6.3.6 Vectors</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX397"></A>


<P>
Vectors are heterogenous structures whose elements are indexed
by integers.  A vector typically occupies less space than a list
of the same length, and the average time required to access a randomly
chosen element is typically less for the vector than for the list.


<P>
The <EM>length</EM> of a vector is the number of elements that it
contains.  This number is a non-negative integer that is fixed when the
vector is created.  The <EM>valid indexes</EM> of a
<A NAME="IDX398"></A>
vector are the exact non-negative integers less than the length of the
vector.  The first element in a vector is indexed by zero, and the last
element is indexed by one less than the length of the vector.


<P>
Vectors are written using the notation <TT>#(<VAR>obj</VAR> ...)</TT>.
For example, a vector of length 3 containing the number zero in element
0, the list <SAMP>`(2 2 2 2)'</SAMP> in element 1, and the string <SAMP>`"Anna"'</SAMP> in
element 2 can be written as following:



<PRE>

#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")

</PRE>

<P>
Note that this is the external representation of a vector, not an
expression evaluating to a vector.  Like list constants, vector
constants must be quoted:

where <SAMP>`make-promise'</SAMP> is defined as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
A promise may refer to its own value, as in the last example above.
Forcing such a promise may cause the promise to be forced a second time
before the value of the first force has been computed.
This complicates the definition of <SAMP>`make-promise'</SAMP>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Various extensions to this semantics of <SAMP>`delay'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`force'</SAMP>
are supported in some implementations:



<UL>

<LI>

Calling <SAMP>`force'</SAMP> on an object that is not a promise may simply
return the object.

<LI>

It may be the case that there is no means by which a promise can be
operationally distinguished from its forced value.  That is, expressions
like the following may evaluate to either <TT>#t</TT> or to <TT>#f</TT>,
depending on the implementation:


<PRE>
<TT>(eqv? (delay 1) 1)                ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>
(pair? (delay (cons 1 2)))        ==&#62;  <EM>unspecified</EM>
</TT>
</PRE>

<LI>

Some implementations may implement "implicit forcing," where
the value of a promise is forced by primitive procedures like <SAMP>`cdr'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>:

<DT><U>procedure:</U> <B>call-with-current-continuation</B> <I>proc</I>
<DD>


<P>
 <VAR>Proc</VAR> must be a procedure of one
argument. The procedure <SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP> packages
up the current continuation (see the rationale below) as an "escape
procedure" and passes it as an argument to
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>
<VAR>proc</VAR>.  The escape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is
later called, will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at that later
time and will instead use the continuation that was in effect
when the escape procedure was created.  Calling the escape procedure
may cause the invocation of <VAR>before</VAR> and <VAR>after</VAR> thunks installed using
<CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX419"></A>


<P>
The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the continuation to
the original call to <TT>call-with-current-continuation</TT>.
Except for continuations created by the <SAMP>`call-with-values'</SAMP>
procedure, all continuations take exactly one value.  The
effect of passing no value or more than one value to continuations
that were not created by <TT>call-with-values</TT> is unspecified.


<P>
The escape procedure that is passed to <VAR>proc</VAR> has
unlimited extent just like any other procedure in Scheme.  It may be stored
in variables or data structures and may be called as many times as desired.


<P>
The following examples show only the most common ways in which
<SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP> is used.  If all real uses were as
simple as these examples, there would be no need for a procedure with
the power of <SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP>.

</TT>
</PRE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>


<P>
A common use of <SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP> is for
structured, non-local exits from loops or procedure bodies, but in fact
<SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP> is extremely useful for implementing a
wide variety of advanced control structures.


<P>
Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a
<EM>continuation</EM> wanting the result of the expression.  The continuation
<A NAME="IDX420"></A>
represents an entire (default) future for the computation.  If the expression is
evaluated at top level, for example, then the continuation might take the
result, print it on the screen, prompt for the next input, evaluate it, and
so on forever.  Most of the time the continuation includes actions
specified by user code, as in a continuation that will take the result,
multiply it by the value stored in a local variable, add seven, and give
the answer to the top level continuation to be printed.  Normally these
ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind the scenes and programmers do not
think much about them.  On rare occasions, however, a programmer may
need to deal with continuations explicitly.
<SAMP>`Call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP> allows Scheme programmers to do
that by creating a procedure that acts just like the current
continuation.


<P>
Most programming languages incorporate one or more special-purpose
escape constructs with names like <TT>exit</TT>, <SAMP>`return'</SAMP>, or
even <TT>goto</TT>.  In 1965, however, Peter Landin <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB16">[Landin65]</A>
invented a general purpose escape operator called the J-operator.  John
Reynolds <A HREF="r5rs_13.html#BIB24">[Reynolds72]</A> described a simpler but equally powerful
construct in 1972.  The <SAMP>`catch'</SAMP> special form described by Sussman
and Steele in the 1975 report on Scheme is exactly the same as
Reynolds's construct, though its name came from a less general construct
in MacLisp.  Several Scheme implementors noticed that the full power of the
<CODE>catch</CODE> construct could be provided by a procedure instead of by a
<A NAME="IDX421"></A>
special syntactic construct, and the name
<SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP> was coined in 1982.  This name is
descriptive, but opinions differ on the merits of such a long name, and
some people use the name <CODE>call/cc</CODE> instead.

<VAR>Before</VAR> and <VAR>after</VAR> are called, also without arguments, as required

captured using <CODE>call-with-current-continuation</CODE> the three arguments are
<A NAME="IDX427"></A>
called once each, in order).  <VAR>Before</VAR> is called whenever execution
enters the dynamic extent of the call to <VAR>thunk</VAR> and <VAR>after</VAR> is called
whenever it exits that dynamic extent.  The dynamic extent of a procedure
call is the period between when the call is initiated and when it
returns.  In Scheme, because of <SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP>, the
dynamic extent of a call may not be a single, connected time period.
It is defined as follows:



<UL>

<LI>

The dynamic extent is entered when execution of the body of the
called procedure begins.

<LI>

The dynamic extent is also entered when execution is not within
the dynamic extent and a continuation is invoked that was captured
(using <SAMP>`call-with-current-continuation'</SAMP>) during the dynamic extent.

<LI>

It is exited when the called procedure returns.

<LI>

It is also exited when execution is within the dynamic extent and
a continuation is invoked that was captured while not within the
dynamic extent.

</UL>

<P>
If a second call to <SAMP>`dynamic-wind'</SAMP> occurs within the dynamic extent of the
call to <VAR>thunk</VAR> and then a continuation is invoked in such a way that the
<VAR>after</VAR>s from these two invocations of <SAMP>`dynamic-wind'</SAMP> are both to be
called, then the <VAR>after</VAR> associated with the second (inner) call to
<SAMP>`dynamic-wind'</SAMP> is called first.


<P>
If a second call to <SAMP>`dynamic-wind'</SAMP> occurs within the dynamic extent of the
call to <VAR>thunk</VAR> and then a continuation is invoked in such a way that the

called, then the <VAR>before</VAR> associated with the first (outer) call to

<P>
If invoking a continuation requires calling the <VAR>before</VAR> from one call
to <SAMP>`dynamic-wind'</SAMP> and the <VAR>after</VAR> from another, then the <VAR>after</VAR>
is called first.

The effect of using a captured continuation to enter or exit the dynamic
extent of a call to <VAR>before</VAR> or <VAR>after</VAR> is undefined.

<P>
<SAMP>`Read'</SAMP> converts external representations of Scheme objects into the
objects themselves.  That is, it is a parser for the nonterminal
&#60;datum&#62; (see sections see section <A HREF="r5rs_9.html#SEC74">7.1.2 External representations</A> and
see section <A HREF="r5rs_8.html#SEC59">6.3.2 Pairs and lists</A>).  <SAMP>`Read'</SAMP> returns the next
object parsable from the given input <VAR>port</VAR>, updating <VAR>port</VAR> to point to
the first character past the end of the external representation of the object.


<P>
If an end of file is encountered in the input before any
characters are found that can begin an object, then an end of file
object is returned.  
 The port remains open, and further attempts
to read will also return an end of file object.  If an end of file is
encountered after the beginning of an object's external representation,
but the external representation is incomplete and therefore not parsable,
an error is signalled.


<P>
The <VAR>port</VAR> argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by <SAMP>`current-input-port'</SAMP>.  It is an error to read from
a closed port.

<P>
Returns the next character available from the input <VAR>port</VAR>,

the <VAR>port</VAR> to point to the following character.  If no more characters
are available, an end of file object is returned.  <VAR>Port</VAR> may be

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>
The value returned by a call to <SAMP>`peek-char'</SAMP> is the same as the
value that would have been returned by a call to <SAMP>`read-char'</SAMP> with the
same <VAR>port</VAR>.  The only difference is that the very next call to
<SAMP>`read-char'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`peek-char'</SAMP> on that <VAR>port</VAR> will return the
value returned by the preceding call to <SAMP>`peek-char'</SAMP>.  In particular, a call
to <SAMP>`peek-char'</SAMP> on an interactive port will hang waiting for input
whenever a call to <SAMP>`read-char'</SAMP> would have hung.

Returns <TT>#t</TT> if <VAR>obj</VAR> is an end of file object, otherwise returns

<P>
Returns <TT>#t</TT> if a character is ready on the input <VAR>port</VAR> and
returns <TT>#f</TT> otherwise.  If <SAMP>`char-ready'</SAMP> returns <TT>#t</TT> then
the next <SAMP>`read-char'</SAMP> operation on the given <VAR>port</VAR> is guaranteed
not to hang.  If the <VAR>port</VAR> is at end of file then <SAMP>`char-ready?'</SAMP>
returns <TT>#t</TT>.  <VAR>Port</VAR> may be omitted, in which case it defaults to
the value returned by <SAMP>`current-input-port'</SAMP>.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
<SAMP>`Char-ready?'</SAMP> exists to make it possible for a program to
accept characters from interactive ports without getting stuck waiting for
input.  Any input editors associated with such ports must ensure that
characters whose existence has been asserted by <SAMP>`char-ready?'</SAMP> cannot
be rubbed out.  If <SAMP>`char-ready?'</SAMP> were to return <TT>#f</TT> at end of
file, a port at end of file would be indistinguishable from an interactive
port that has no ready characters.

Writes a written representation of <VAR>obj</VAR> to the given <VAR>port</VAR>.  Strings

within those strings backslash and doublequote characters are
escaped by backslashes.
Character objects are written using the <SAMP>`#\'</SAMP> notation.

<P>
Writes a representation of <VAR>obj</VAR> to the given <VAR>port</VAR>.  Strings
that appear in the written representation are not enclosed in
doublequotes, and no characters are escaped within those strings.  Character
objects appear in the representation as if written by <SAMP>`write-char'</SAMP>
instead of by <SAMP>`write'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`Display'</SAMP> returns an unspecified value.
The <VAR>port</VAR> argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by <SAMP>`current-output-port'</SAMP>.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
<SAMP>`Write'</SAMP> is intended
for producing machine-readable output and <SAMP>`display'</SAMP> is for producing
human-readable output.  Implementations that allow "slashification"
within symbols will probably want <SAMP>`write'</SAMP> but not <SAMP>`display'</SAMP> to
slashify funny characters in symbols.

<P>
Questions of system interface generally fall outside of the domain of this
report.  However, the following operations are important enough to
deserve description here.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX468"></A>
<DL>
<DT><U>optional procedure:</U> <B>load</B> <I>filename</I>
<DD>


<P>
<VAR>Filename</VAR> should be a string naming an existing file
containing Scheme source code.  The <SAMP>`load'</SAMP> procedure reads
expressions and definitions from the file and evaluates them
sequentially.  It is unspecified whether the results of the expressions
are printed.  The <SAMP>`load'</SAMP> procedure does not affect the values
returned by <SAMP>`current-input-port'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`current-output-port'</SAMP>.
<SAMP>`Load'</SAMP> returns an unspecified value.



<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Rationale:</EM>
For portability, <SAMP>`load'</SAMP> must operate on source files.
Its operation on other kinds of files necessarily varies among
implementations.

<DT><U>optional procedure:</U> <B>transcript-on</B> <I>filename</I>
<DD>
<DT><U>optional procedure:</U> <B>transcript-off</B>
<DD>


<P>
<VAR>Filename</VAR> must be a string naming an output file to be
created. The effect of <SAMP>`transcript-on'</SAMP> is to open the named file
for output, and to cause a transcript of subsequent interaction between
the user and the Scheme system to be written to the file.  The
transcript is ended by a call to <SAMP>`transcript-off'</SAMP>, which closes the
transcript file.  Only one transcript may be in progress at any time,
though some implementations may relax this restriction.  The values
returned by these procedures are unspecified.

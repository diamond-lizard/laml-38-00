   "syntax-rules"
   (form "(syntax-rules literals (pattern template)...)")
   (description "The <pattern> in a <syntax rule> is a list <pattern> that begins with the keyword for the macro. -
  A <pattern> is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the following
  (<pattern> ...),
  (<pattern> <pattern> ... . <pattern>),
  (<pattern> ... <pattern> <ellipsis>),
  #(<pattern> ...), or
  #(<pattern> ... <pattern> <ellipsis>).
A template is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the following
  (<element> ...),
  (<element> <element> ... . <template>), or
  #(<element> ...)
where an <element> is a <template> optionally followed by an <ellipsis> and an <ellipsis> is the identifier '...' (which cannot be used as an identifier in either a template or a pattern).-
Semantics: An instance of syntax-rules produces a new macro transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules. A use of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer specified by syntax-rules is matched against the patterns contained in the <syntax rule>s, beginning with the leftmost <syntax rule>. When a match is found, the macro use is transcribed hygienically according to the template.-
An identifier that appears in the pattern of a <syntax rule> is a pattern variable, unless it is the keyword that begins the pattern, is listed in <literals>, or is the identifier .... Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and are used to refer to elements of the input in the template. It is an error for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a <pattern>.- 
The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a <syntax rule> is not involved in the matching and is not considered a pattern variable or literal identifier.- 
    Rationale: The scope of the keyword is determined by the expression or syntax definition that binds it to the associated macro transformer. If the keyword were a pattern variable or literal identifier, then the template that follows the pattern would be within its scope regardless of whether the keyword were bound by let-syntax or by letrec-syntax. -
Identifiers that appear in <literals> are interpreted as literal identifiers to be matched against corresponding subforms of the input. A subform in the input matches a literal identifier if and only if it is an identifier and either both its occurrence in the macro expression and its occurrence in the macro definition have the same lexical binding, or the two identifiers are equal and both have no lexical binding.-
A subpattern followed by ... can match zero or more elements of the input. It is an error for ... to appear in <literals>. Within a pattern the identifier ... must follow the last element of a nonempty sequence of subpatterns. ")

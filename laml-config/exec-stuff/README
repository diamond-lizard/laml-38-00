In this directory there are different versions
of the command files, which starts laml and schemedoc.

Required naming schemes:

  <laml-platform>_<operating-system>_<scheme-system>_laml
  <laml-platform>_<operating-system>_<scheme-system>_schemedoc

<laml-platform>, <operating-system>, and <scheme-system> as defined in ../configuration.

Notice: In case mzscheme-200 or mzscheme-300 is used in the configuration file,
<scheme-system> should be given as mzscheme above.

During configuration the appropriate laml, laml.bat, and schemedoc files
are copied to the LAML bin directory.

If - during configuration - an appropriate laml exec
file cannot be located, we use <laml-platform>-default-laml or <laml-platform>-default-schemedoc
Such a file just writes an informative error message.

In case you port LAML to a new platform you are supposed to make
an appropriate template files in this directory, using 
the naming scheme explained above. It may be helpful to study
the existing laml files in this directory in order
to find good solutions.

Any help filling out "the holes" in this directory is much appreciated.


December 2005: The activation of LAML from an operating system command prompt has
been changed. It is now necessary to use the laml extension, or a similar extension such
as sdoc.

rem  Copied and modified by the LAML installation process - DO NOT EDIT.
rem  This bat file is used from Windows (win95,95 but NOT nt40) to process an LAML file.
rem  Usage: laml file
rem  file is with the laml extension.
rem  Necessary adaptation:
rem   1. change LAMLDIR to reflect the LAML directory with your LAML installation
rem   2. Change the path to mzScheme
set LAMLDIR=@laml-dir@
set CDIR=
setenv CDIR %%cwd
rem echo Output dir is now set to "%CDIR%"
@command-scheme-exec@ -v -f %LAMLDIR%laml.init -d %1 %1 %CDIR%\
echo Done

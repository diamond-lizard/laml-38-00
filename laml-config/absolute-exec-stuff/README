In this directory there are different versions
of the command files, which starts laml. The absolute version,
absolute-laml takes an absolute path to the directory, in which
the laml file is located. This is useful for cron jobs, for instance.

Required naming scheme:

  <laml-platform>_<operating-system>_<scheme-system>_absolute-laml

<laml-platform>, <operating-system>, and <scheme-system> as defined in ../configuration.

Notice: In case mzscheme-200 or mzscheme-300 is used in the configuration file,
<scheme-system> should be given as mzscheme above.

During configuration the appropriate absolute-laml file is
copied to the LAML bin directory.

Currently, we only support absolute-laml execs with mzscheme on UNIX solaris and Linux platforms.

If - during configuration - an appropriate absolute-laml exec
file cannot be located, we use <laml-platform>-default-absolute-laml.

In case you port LAML to a new platform you can make
an appropriate absolute-laml file in this directory, using 
the naming scheme explained above. It may be helpful to study
the existing absolute-laml files in this directory in order
to find good solutions.

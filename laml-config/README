The file  configuration  is the file to change when you install LAML on your
computer.

laml-config.scm is the program that performs the installation. As it appears
if you read that file, laml-config-internal.scm is the program that does the 
real work.

If you already have a running LAML system on your computer you can reconfigure
LAML conveniently by processing the script default-config.laml

After installation/reconfiguration of LAML, you should restart Emacs.
Also, check your .emacs file.  Search for "LAML" or "laml-emacs-support.el"


PORTING LAML:

If you intend to port LAML to a new Scheme system, or to another operating
system or platform, be sure to consult the web page

  info/porting-laml.html

relative to a full LAML distribution, or on this URL

  http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/scheme/info/porting-laml.html  




AALBORG UNIVERSITY ONLY:

The accompanying laml file, cs-unix-config.laml is a script I use to
activate the configuration program on our Unix Solaris machine, and
cs-linux-configuration is the configuration related to the
script. You CANNOT use any of these without prior modifications. But
you can maybe use these files for inspiration.


Current configuration file on CS unix at Aalborg University:

   cs-linux-configuration

Accompanying laml script file which does the configuration job:

   cs-unix-config.laml

Files which are used in the LAML configuration process.

The files dot-emacs-contribution.el, laml.el, and
laml.scm are the sources of

  emacs-support/dot-emacs-contribution.el
  laml.scm
  laml.el

in your LAML distribution. In case you need to change
aspects of theses files, please do so in this directory.

laml.init is an auxiliary file for LAML startup in certain Scheme systems.

The LAML installation process copies them (slightly modified)
to their destinations.

;  THIS FILE CONTAINS A LISP ASSOCIATION LIST WITH A LAML CONFIGURATION.
;  AN ASSOCIATION LIST IS A LIST OF KEY-VALUE PAIRS: (key . value).
;  EDIT THIS FILE BY CHANGING THE VALUES OF THE KEYS (AT THE
;  POSITIONS AFTER THE DOTS). THERE ARE ALREADY EXAMPLES OF
;  VALUES (SUCH AS "c:/programs/laml/") IN THIS FILE.
;  AFTER YOU HAVE EDITED THIS FILE PLEASE LOAD THE FILE 
;  laml-config.scm IN YOUR SCHEME SYSTEM. THIS IS THE SCHEME PROGRAM
;  WHICH PERFORMS THE CONFIGURATIN PROCESS. THE LOADING PROCESS WILL
;  READ THE CURRENT FILE, configuration, AND IT WILL CONFIGURE LAML 
;  ON YOUR COMPUTER.
;
;  NOTICE THAT THE EXISTING VALUES IN THIS FILE REFLECT A WINDOWS 2000 
;  OR WINDOWS XP SETUP WITH PLT MZSCHEME (version 200 .. 209).

  ; mzscheme-200 refers to version 200 - 209. 
  ; mzscheme-300 refers to version 300 - 372. 
  ; (It is NOT possible to use LAML with MzScheme 400+, nor with Racket version 5+).
  ; drscheme refers to versions smaller than 200 of DrScheme.
  ; drscheme-300 refers to version 300 - 372 of DrScheme.

  ; (#f means boolean false).
  ; Use forward slashes in the path.
  ; Do not include any file extension (such as '.exe').

  ; LAML configuration program to change your .emacs file.
  ; If you do not have an emacs init file, the LAML configuration program
  ; will make one for you. In case you do NOT want the LAML configuration 
  ; process to modify your emacs init file, the value of this property should

  ; The laml init file allows you to customize and extend LAML.
  ; The laml init file is loaded by the function begin-laml, which always should be
  ; called when program loading has been completed.
  ; The laml init file is only loaded if it actually exists.
  ; If you delete this clause, or if you specify the value #f,

  ; but they are short and convenient.
  ; Hygienic keybindings all start with C-c, and as such they do not conflict
  ; with other keybindings. If "none" is specified, no keybindings will be made.
  ; Menu bindings will be made even if "none" is specified as the value of

;  THIS FILE CONTAINS A LISP ASSOCIATION LIST WITH A LAML CONFIGURATION.
;  AN ASSOCIATION LIST IS A LIST OF KEY-VALUE PAIRS: (key . value).
;  EDIT THIS FILE BY CHANGING THE VALUES OF THE KEYS (AT THE
;  POSITIONS AFTER THE DOTS). THERE ARE ALREADY EXAMPLES OF
;  VALUES (SUCH AS "c:/Users/Kurt/laml/") IN THIS FILE.
;  AFTER YOU HAVE EDITED THIS FILE PLEASE LOAD THE FILE 
;  laml-config.scm IN YOUR SCHEME SYSTEM. THIS IS THE SCHEME PROGRAM
;  WHICH PERFORMS THE CONFIGURATIN PROCESS. THE LOADING PROCESS WILL
;  READ THE CURRENT FILE, configuration, AND IT WILL CONFIGURE LAML 
;  ON YOUR COMPUTER.
;
;  NOTICE THAT THE EXISTING VALUES IN THIS FILE REFLECT A WINDOWS 2000 
;  OR WINDOWS XP SETUP WITH MZSCHEME PLT 205.


(
  ; A full and absolute path to the directory in which LAML is located.
  ; Always use forward slashes in the path.
  ; The last character should be a '/'.

  ; Which Scheme system do you use:   mzscheme, mzscheme-200, scm, guile, sisc, or drscheme.
  ; mzscheme refers to versions smaller than 200 of MzScheme (103, 101, ...).
  ; mzscheme-200 refers to version 200 or larger. As of July 2004, version 207 applies.
  ; drscheme means versions smaller than 200 of DrScheme.
  ; The value of the cons pair should be a symbol or a string.

  (scheme-system . "mzscheme-200")                  ; <== Edit here


  ; On which platform do you install LAML: windows, unix, or mac.
  ; If you use linux use unix here.
  ; If you use max OSX, use unix here too.
  ; The given value should be a symbol or a string

  (laml-platform . "unix")                   ; <== Edit here


  ; Which operating system do you use: win98, win95, nt40, win2000,
  ; solaris-6, solaris-7, or linux.
  ; If you use Windows XP you should write win2000 below.
  ; If you use solaris in a newver version than 7, you should use solaris-7.
  ; I have tested LAML on win98, nt40, win2000, solaris-7, and linux
  ; The value of operating-system should be a symbol or a string.

  (operating-system . "linux")                ; <== Edit here


  ; The absolute path to your Scheme executable to be used from Emacs.
  ; Use forward slashes in the path.
  ; Do not include any file extension (such as '.exe').

  ; The full path to your emacs init file (.emacs file).
  ; If you give the path to you emacs init file here, you allow the
  ; LAML configuration program to change your .emacs file.
  ; If you do not have an emacs init file, the LAML configuration program
  ; will make one for you. In case you do NOT want the LAML configuration 
  ; process to modify your emacs init file, the value of this property should
  ; be #f (which is Scheme's representation of 'false').

  (emacs-init-file . "/user/normark/.emacs")             ; <== Edit here


  ; The full path to you laml init file (such as .laml). 
  ; Mostly for advanced laml users. 
  ; If you igore it you will have no laml init file, which is OK for most
  ; LAML users.
  ; The value of laml-init-file must be a string (file path), or the boolean #f.
  ; The laml init file allows you to customize and extend LAML.
  ; The laml init file is loaded as the last action in laml.scm, 
  ; but only if the laml init file actually exists.
  ; If you delete this clause, or if you specify the value #f,
  ; no laml init file is supported by your installation.

  ; Control of Emacs keybindings.
  ; Possible values are "original", "hygienic", and "none".
  ; The original keybindings are the LAML binding, prior to version 22.
  ; Some original keybindings may be in conflict with other Emacs key bindings.
  ; Hygienic keybindings all start with C-c, and as such they do not conflict
  ; with other keybindings. If "none" is specified, no keybindings are will be made.
  ; Menu bindings will be made, even if "none" is specified as the value of 
  ; emacs-keybindings.

  ; Leno is a LAML based system for production of slides and teaching
  ; material.  If you want Emacs support of LENO, the value of
  ; leno-emacs-support should be #t.  If not, it should be #f. If you
  ; select Emacs support for LENO, a number of key bindings and
  ; menu bindings will be in effect.

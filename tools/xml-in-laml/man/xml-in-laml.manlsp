(abstract . " This is the LAML tool that generates the language specific part of an XML mirror in Scheme. From version 20 of LAML, this tool is able to generate a fully validating mirror i Scheme of an XML language from a parsed XML DTD. <p> For validation purposes, this tool generates deterministic final state automata from the parsed content models, as delivered by the LAML XML DTD parser. These automata are embedded in the validation predicates which accompany the mirror functions in Scheme of the XML elements.<p> The generated mirrors rely heavily on the common part, which is shared for all XML-in-LAML languages. The common part is found in lib/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm, and a <a href=\"../../../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html\">XML-in-LAML common library manual</a> is available.<p> Let us denote the language by the symbol L.  As input this tool takes a parsed DTD, L.dtd, in the Lisp representation made by the LAML <a href=\"../../dtd-parser/man/dtd-parser.html\">DTD parser</a>. As output the LAML mirror generation tool makes a file L-mirror.scm in the mirror-target-dir.<p> The tool is typically driven by a LAML script  (such as <a href=\"../sample-mirror-generation/make-xhtml10-transitional-mirror.laml\"> the script for generation of XHTML 1.0 transitional</a>).<p> An easy way to use the mirror generation tool is via the procedure <a href=\"../../../man/laml.html#generate-xml-mirror\">generate-xml-mirror</a> in the fundamental LAML setup library, called laml.scm.<p> The main procedure in LAML mirror generation tool is generate-mirror (see below). As such, the tool can be identified with the generate-mirror procedure.<p> Please consult <a href = \"../../../tutorial/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.html\">\"XML mirrors in Scheme: XML in LAML\"</a> (section 3) for a tutorial introduction to the use of the tool.<p> From LAML version 26, attributes list corresponding to the same element name, are merged to a single attribute list.

This directory contains the tool which makes LAML mirrors of XML
languages. This is xml-in-laml.scm.

In the distribution (full only):
In subdirectories you find LAML scripts for concrete tool generation 
together with the runtime parts (content validation predicates).

In general, the tool produces mirrors which are organized in 
lib/xml-in-laml/mirrors/. There are some exceptions, such as LENO,
which is kept in an xml-in-laml branch of the styles directory.

In the tools directory (../) you will find specific LAML tools,
which may have an xml-in-laml subdirectory for xml-in-laml
compliant tools.



As other good examples of LAML mirror generation in the full
distribution, see styles/xml-in-laml/lecture-notes/dtd/,
styles/xml-in-laml/course-plan/dtd/,
styles/xml-in-laml/photo-show/dtd/, and
styles/xml-in-laml/manual/dtd/.

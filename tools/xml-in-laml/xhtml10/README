A common directory for generation of all three xhtml10 mirrors: strict, validating, frameset.
Also contains manual generation stuff.

The temp is used internally by make-xhtml10-all-mirrors.laml

The script make-xhtml-mirrors-and-manuals.laml both makes the three mirrors and
the three manuals.

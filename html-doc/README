The directory in which we represent HTML manuals from w3.

The file html-knowledge maps element names to the necessary URL part of the URLs 
to the resprective documentation of the elements.

The html401 directory contains the downloaded HTML4.01 documentation from w3.

I have removed the element

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href= 
  "http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-REC">

from all html files in order to avoid that the browser tries to access 
the potentially remote W3C site to access the style sheet.

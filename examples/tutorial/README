If you modify the examples in this directory, or
in one of the subdirectories, you may break or destroy
your local copy of the LAML tutorial.

The reason is that the LAML tutorial makes heavy use
of the examples.

You should consider to make a copy of the examples/tutorial
(the current directory) before modifying the examples.

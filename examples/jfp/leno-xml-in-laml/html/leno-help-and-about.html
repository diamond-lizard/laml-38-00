         in a number of chapters (or lectures). The top-level page refers to each lecuture
         in the material. Each lecture, in turn, refers to a number of pages.<p>As an important characteristics of LENO, each page can be shown
         in at least three, and depending on the material, possibly four different views:<p><ul><li type = "disc">A slide view</li><li type = "disc">An annotated slide view</li><li type = "disc">An aggregated lecture view</li><li type = "disc">A thematic view</li></ul><p>In  <em>slide view</em>  the primary information on a page is shown using
         a large font, hereby making it attractive to present the information
         from browser via a projector in an auditorium.<p>In the  <em>annotated slide view</em>  the primary information is shown with
         a number of annotations, which are associated with the individual
         constituents of a slides. As in slide view, a single page is shown
         in isolation from all other pages, but links to the previous and 
         the next page exists.<p>An  <em>aggregated lecture view</em>  shows the primary slide information
         and the annotations of all pages in a lecture. Thus, in this view, the pages 
         of a lecture are all aggregated into a single 'lecture page'.
         The information contents of this view is the same as the sum of
         the information of the all annotated slides in a single lecture.<p>The  <em>thematic view</em>  typically shows most slide elements, including the annotations,
          with additional interleavning text. Typically, but not necessarily, a theme correspond to a section
          of slides. In a theme, elements such as programs, images, tables, and exercises may be numbered.
          hierarchically. Themes are not always present in a LENO-based material. It takes extra efforts by
          the autor to create a thematic view of the material. Use the the yellow T icon to navigate to thematic
          expositions, if they are available.<p>In addition, LENO supports generation of an automatically progressing slide show with the teacher's speaker sound. 
          For this to work, the author needs to record the speaker sound and prepare the sequencing and timing
          of the individual pages in the show.
          An automatically progressing slide show with speaker sound is started from the lecture overview page,
          with one of the small speaker icons or from
          one of the textually anchored links just above the note page table. The slide show brings you through selected slide pages, 
          programs, and image series. Notice that some of the slide pages my be visited more than once (such as before and
          after an external program page or image series - with different speaker sounds). The speaker sound is streamed to
          your browser, and currently it relies on RealPlayer from  <a href = "http://www.real.com">http://www.real.com</a> . For setup see for instance
           <a href = "http://video.auc.dk/">Aalborg University's video pages</a> .

Using a LENO trail it is
          possible to define a sequence of slides from selected slides in a number of sections. The
          trail determines the selection and the sequence of slides. This is useful if you want to present
          a subset of your slides for some purpose, and if you don't want to deal with multiple copies (which is usually a bad solution).
          The LENO trail facilities is realized via use of HTML frames. The red icons from above
          are all shown in a frame of its own (in the leftmost margin), the trail navigation frame. Notice that
          you can navigate freely in the slide trail while maintaining the context of the trail.<p>The keyboard shortcuts only work in Internet Explorer 4.0 and higher (from Microsoft), but not
           yet in Mozilla or Netscape.
           The keyboard shortcuts of programs, exercises, and image series are integers in the range 1..9, corresponding
           to the sequence of these on a slide or annotated slide.<p>The collection of html WWW pages, which constitute a set of lecture notes, are generated from a source
           file written in the programming language Scheme. Scheme is a language
           in the Lisp family of languages. We use Scheme as a markup language.
           In a Scheme-based language it is easy to define your own markup
           elements by means of abstraction. The underlying system, called LAML
           (Lisp Abstracted Markup Language) is described in further detail in <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/laml/">The LAML home page</a> .<p>Kurt Nørmark <br> Aalborg University <br> normark@cs.auc.dk <br> <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/">http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/</a></td></tr></table></body></html>

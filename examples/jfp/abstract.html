There is also
a good fit between S-expressions in Lisp and the means of expression in HTML and XML.  These
similarities are exploited in LAML (Lisp Abstracted Markup Language) which is a software
package for Scheme. LAML supports exact mirrors of different versions of HTML.  In the mirrors
each HTML element is represented by a named function in Scheme.
The mirror functions guaranty that the generated HTML code is valid. LAML has been used
for both server side CGI programming and programmatic authoring of non-trivial static web materials.
The programmatic LAML author can use the power of functional programming for the production of
everyday web documents. Equally important, it is straightforward to define domain-specific web languages
in Scheme syntax which parallel the advantages of XML.</blockquote> <p><a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/laml/papers/jfp.pdf">Full paper</a> in PDF format</p></body></html>

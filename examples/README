This is a collection of different LAML/SchemeDoc examples.

The examples can be reached from the HTML documentation via ../index.html
(Use the example column of the big table).

You can process these files individually, or (in some distributions)
via the process-all.laml scripts at different levels.

If the tutorial directory is in your distribution, you should NOT
change the files in there, because they are used in the LAML tutorial,
at ../tutorial/index.html.

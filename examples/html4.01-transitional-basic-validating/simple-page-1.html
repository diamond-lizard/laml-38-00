         This page demonstrates a few of the functions in the HTML 4.0 loose basic library.
      </p>
      <p>
         <em>
            This paragraph has been emphasized by means of the 
            <b>em</b>
             
            function
            .
         </em>
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>
            The above paragraph is not valid, because we emphasize a p element using the em
            element.       It should be the other way around: emphasizing the contents of the
            pagragraph, like done here...
         </b>
      </p>
      <p>
         I hope that you already have realized that the level of this library is inconvenient
         for most purposes.

   A collection of tools for creation of advanced and comprehensive course home pages
   is presented. The tools cover the spectrum from course overview pages, over
   hypertext teaching materials, to interactive services that support the teaching 
   activities during the course.
   From the teacher's perspective the tools allow for abstraction from details and
   automation of routine work in the authoring process.
   Furthermore, the interactive services provide for evaluation of the actual
   teaching activities via student feedback and collected statistics.
   Seen from a student's perspective
   the comprehensive linking of of course plans, teaching material, and interactive service
   together with links to external WWW material provides for a valuable 
   organization of a large body of information.<p>Notice that this version is an early edition of the paper. Here it primarily

  A course home page may in one extreme cover a single page with a course overview.
  In the other extreme, a course home page is a network of pages with
  a complete set of courses resources, such as plans
  (including a calendar and overviews in various details) course reading materials (book or course notes,
  possibly in several editions), exercises, solutions to exercises,
  and interactive services, such as synchronous and asynchronous tools
  which mediate a dialogue between the students and the teacher.
  The plans, reading materials, and the interactive course services
  are often integrated via mutual links.<p>In this paper we will describe an integerated suite of WWW-based tools
  which, taken together, provides an extensive and advanced support of a
  university course in computer science. All the tools are built on the
  same technical platform, using a technology called LAML [<a href = "#Normark99b">1</a>,<a href = "#Normark99c">2</a>,<a href = "#Normark99f">3</a>] which we have
  developed as part of our efforts.  In this paper we will concentrate
  on the course impact of the tools, hereby emphasizing organizational
  and pedagogical issues. The technical issues involved are addressed
  elsewhere in first two references mentioned above.<p>In the following sections we will discuss, and give an
  overview of the tools we have made during the last two years, in order
  to support a computer science programming course (object-oriented
  programming in Java). In section <a href = "#cp" title = "The Course Plan System">2</a> we describe the overall course plan system,
  which generates the 'home page' as such together with overviews of each lecture. In section <a href = "#leno" title = "The Lecture Note System">3</a> we go on with an overview of the lecture note system, via which it is possible
  to create a multi-view, hypertext-based teaching material. In section <a href = "#em" title = "Synchronous Exercise Management">4</a> and <a href = "#idafus" title = "Asynchronous Activity Management">5</a> we discuss the interactive services used on the course. Prior to the 
  conclusion we briefly discuss a number of integration issues.</font><p><a name = "cp"></a><font size = "5" color = "#0000ff">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Course Plan System</font><br><font color = "#000000">As a fundamental premise, we have decided to base the entire suite of
  tool on documents in pure HTML [<a href = "#html40">4</a>]. This is a contrast to using
  specialized formats (calling for browser plugins) Java applets, or
  dynamic HTML such Java Script.  By this decision our
  materials can seen from any machine with a modern Internet browser,
  without having to download or install any additional software.
  This provides for ideal availability of the materials across all platforms,
  on university machines as well as on the student's home equipment.
<p>A typical course home page covers a network of WWW pages
  which presents an overview of the course together
  with detailed descriptions and presentations of individual lectures.
  A number of details may occur redundantly on several pages.  A course home
  page embodies knowledge about the following aspects:<p><table border = "0"><tr><td width = "10" valign = "top"></td><td width = "*" valign = "top"><b>Course constituents</b>: Concepts such a plenum sessions, exercises, project work, and lab sessions,
       together with the mutual structuring among theses.<p><b>Course content</b>: The topics covered during the lectures of the course.<p><b>Course materials</b>: Description of and references to required or recommended reading material.<p><b>Training plans</b>: Proposed exercises together with resources which help the students to deal with problems during
       the exercises.<p><b>Overall sequencing</b>: The mutual ordering of the lectures in the course.<p><b>Spatial and temporal details</b>: Where and when the course activities happen in terms of time slots and allocated rooms.</td></tr></table><p>It is not efficient to deal with this body of information in a collection of WWW pages,
  where also details about layout, typography, and decoration are addressed.
  We have made a <em>course plan system</em> which as input takes a complete and clean <em>course model</em>, and outputs a set of pages representing the 'course home page'.
  The course model separates relatively stable aspects of a course (such as topics covered)
  from the more fluctuating aspects (such as room and time information). In that way
  it becomes much easier to revise the course home page from one year to the next.
  Similarly, it is very flexible to change the course schedule, for instance due to 
  a necessary postponement of a number of lectures.
  The top-level page presents an overview menu frame to the left, and some
  selected page to the right. Figure <a href = "#course-plan-figure" title = "A snapshot of a demo course plan WWW page.">1</a> shows a snapshot a home page generated by the course plan system.
  (For better readability in this verion of the paper,
  the example is also available via an <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/scheme/examples/course-plan/html/course-home.html">URL</a>.) <center><p><a name = "course-plan-figure"></a><img alt = "" src = "course-plan-screenshot.jpg" border = "0"><p><table border = "0"><tr><td width = "35" valign = "top"></td><td width = "*" valign = "top"><em>Figure 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;A snapshot of a demo course plan WWW page.</em></td><td width = "35" valign = "top"></td></tr></table></center><p>As one of the novel aspects of the course plan system, all information about time stems from a single list
  of 'lecture start times' together with additional information about the course model (involving
  details about the mutual timing of exercises and the plenum lecture).
  The system uses a central lecture description table which relates particular lectures to topics,
  times, and rooms. In addition, the table defines the sequencing among the lectures.
  Several different overviews can be generated, including
  simple listings of the course contents and calendar presentations, which plot the
  lectures into a semester overview calendar (with a possibility of merging calendar entries for other courses, attended
  by the students). The generated pages share a common layout, including a number of 
  useful standard links to course relevant resources.
  The lecture pages, which deal with details such as literature and exercises, can
  be processed individually. Alternatively, 
  the complete set of pages can be regenerated by executing a single command.
  In the current system, the course model is represented
  in a textual 'programmatic' format. We are considering a more user friendly (but probably less powerful)
  supplementary interface based on WWW forms [<a href = "#html40">4</a>].</font><p><a name = "leno"></a><font size = "5" color = "#0000ff">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lecture Note System</font><br><font color = "#000000">Many teachers use transparencies and slides during a plenum lecture session. Such teaching material
  is often produced using presentation programs, such as Powerpoint.
  Most presentation programs were invented before the advent of the World Wide Web and the Internet.
  These programs can produce online documents, presentable from a browser, either
  via common documented formats (such as postscript of pdf), 
  via vendor supplied 'browser plug ins', or as bitmapped graphics. 
  However, none of these <em>secondary formats</em> provides for a smooth integration with the rest of
  the resources on the Internet (for instance the course plan pages discussed above)
  nor full utilization of the power of hypertext.<p>We have made an alternative to these presentation programs, which produces
  slides in HTML as the <em>primary format</em>. The system, called LENO, processes a 
  textual input file in a particular format, and produces a set of HTML pages.
  The practical processing procedure is similar to old fashioned text formatting, using 
  LaTeX, for instance.
  The input format, which is called LAML (Lisp Abstracted Markup Language [<a href = "#Normark99c">2</a>])
  is similar to XML [<a href = "#xml10">5</a>], although different from XML when it comes to
  the details. From a technical perspective,
  the LENO input is a program written in the functional programming language Scheme [<a href = "#SchemeHome">6</a>] 
  using a particular library of Scheme functions.
  As a consequence of this, we can provide programmatic solutions to many 
  routine tasks, because a full-fledged programming language is available
  anywhere in a document, and anytime during the authoring process.
  For authors with a computer science background, this programmatic
  approach turns out to an interesting alternative to more conventional
  approaches, where abstraction and automation facilities are rather limited.
<p>We will here enumerate the most important virtues of LENO compared with more
  traditional presentation programs:<p><ul><li type = "disc">LENO organizes a teaching material as hypertext, centered around
      annotated slides, which can be presented by the teacher in an auditorium
      via a labtop computer and a projector.<p></li><li type = "disc">LENO integrates the slides of an entire course into a single, coherent
     and interlinked collection of WWW pages. The slides are organized in a single
     directory structure to provide for easy transportation and download.<p></li><li type = "disc">LENO produces pages with overlapping information contents at three
     different levels of abstractions: As slides using a large font, as
     annotated slides with additional comments and explanations, and as a
     single aggregated page which contains all the lecture note information of
     a single lecture.<p></li><li type = "disc">LENO supports direct inclusion of external, textual material such as
     program source files.  The external material is taken from
     the external file when the HTML files are generated. Hereby we avoid
     inconsistency situations, where program source files are represented in different
     versions (the version in our teaching material and the version
     demonstrated for the student, for instance).  This is a very
     convenient alternative to 'copy and pasting' which leads to 
     several versions of the same information.  It is possible
     to include only part of a text file in the lecture notes.
     Furthermore, LENO supports superposition of colors and font faces on
     the external files, in order to emphasize particular aspects of
     the inclusion. It is, of course, possible to include the same file more than
     once with different emphasis.<p></li><li type = "disc">LENO makes it possible to make special blends of slides from different
     lectures without any replication (copying) of material. This facility
     is realized using the ideas of trails through existing pages in
     different lectures (chapters). The trails are represented as HTML
     frame pages which refer to already generated pages.<p></li><li type = "disc">LENO provides for integration of exercises and exercise solutions into
     the teaching material. In particular, it is possible to generate
     lecture and course wide overviews of exercises and/or solutions, including
     pages with aggregated exercise formulations, aggregated formulations and
     solutions (in order to avoid unwanted fragmentation in paper output, for instance).
     In addition, LENO makes it possible 
     to open up for the exercise solutions at appropriate points of time.  As an
     advanced feature, we can integrate the exercise part of the system
     with synchronous and asynchronous tools for management of the student's work with
     exercises (see section <a href = "#em" title = "Synchronous Exercise Management">4</a>).<p></li><li type = "disc">LENO supports flexible keyboard navigation from page to page on
     selected browsers (realized via a simple Java Script program). This turns out to be
     an essential facility when LENO is used for presentation of many slides
     during a lecture (but it also slightly compromises our ideas of using plain and
     simple HTML).<p></li><li type = "disc">With some forethought (in terms of good abstractions applied to external references)
     it is possible to retarget all external links,
     which for instance provides for CD editions of LENO material as well
     as external material. We have used this for integrated collections of
     LENO notes, Java API material, and Java Tutorial material (all of which
     are represented in HTML).<p></li></ul><p>There are also a number of negative aspects inherent in our approach:<p><ul><li type = "disc">The graphical illustrations in HTML are primitive (gif and jpg
     bitmapped graphics). All graphical illustrations must be created
     with external drawing tools, and converted to the formats which are
     supported by the HTML image tag.<p></li><li type = "disc">The size of a page varies from browser to browser, and from screen to
     screen. Consequently it is hard to avoid scrolling of pages when viewing the
     material.<p></li><li type = "disc">Although all pages in a lecture can be aggregated to a single HTML
     page, the printing of such a page does not always work out nicely. The
     printing of advanced materials from an interenet browser is a
     difficult endeavor, and in current browsers it is not of professional
     quality.  We plan to make a special printed edition via a bridge from LENO to
     a conventional text formatting system such as LaTeX.<p></li><li type = "disc">A teacher who uses using LENO to produce teaching material
     does not use state of the art visual tools, but
     rather more old fashioned text formatting tools and programmatic
     techniques. This eliminates a large number of possible users from
     taking advantage of the virtues discussed above.<p></li></ul><p>Based on our own experience with LENO, we find that the virtues from above
  outweigh the deficiencies. Figure <a href = "#leno-figure" title = "A snapshot of an annotated slide generated by LENO. This particular slide includes
          three program fragments, which are colorized in order to emphasize particular aspects of the code.">2</a> shows a snapshot of an annotated
  slide from LENO.   (For better readability in this verion of the paper,
  the example is also awailable via an <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/scheme/slides/lugm-99-amsterdam/html/lugm99-note-insert-quotation.html">URL</a> .)<p><center><p><a name = "leno-figure"></a><img alt = "" src = "leno-screenshot.jpg" border = "0"><p><table border = "0"><tr><td width = "35" valign = "top"></td><td width = "*" valign = "top"><em>Figure 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;A snapshot of an annotated slide generated by LENO.

During
  the exercises the students get help and advice from the teacher of the course and
  a number of teaching assistants.  Due to the problem-oriented and project-organized
  teaching model at Aalborg University [<a href = "#Kjersdam94">7</a>], the students are located in many small group
  rooms (with 6-7 students in each room).  In this particular course, there
  were 25 groups, three teaching assistants, and the typical
  exercises involved practical programming in Java.<p>It is a major challenge to manage an exercises session which follows the setup described above.
  Concretely, we see the following problems:<p><ul><li type = "disc">How do we know which of the groups are actively working on the exercise?</li><li type = "disc">How do we ensure that a group of students get help when it is needed?</li><li type = "disc">How do we evaluate the result of the exercises session (quantitatively and
     qualitatively)?</li></ul><p>In order to deal with these problems we have created a WWW-based
  interactive exercise manager.  The manager presents itself as a small
  frame, which sticks to the window in which the exercise formulation is
  shown. Figure <a href = "#em-figure" title = "A snapshot of the exercise manager, as attached to a LENO generated WWW page which shows an exercise formulation.">3</a> shows an example.  LENO (as described in section <a href = "#leno" title = "The Lecture Note System">3</a> ) be set
  up to generate the underlying frame set. The exercise manager tool allows the student
  to send brief, one-line messages of particular types, to the teacher via the exercise
  manager server.<p><center><p><a name = "em-figure"></a><img alt = "" src = "em-screenshot.jpg" border = "0"><p><table border = "0"><tr><td width = "35" valign = "top"></td><td width = "*" valign = "top"><em>Figure 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;A snapshot of the exercise manager, as attached to a LENO generated WWW page which shows an exercise formulation.</em></td><td width = "35" valign = "top"></td></tr></table></center><p>From a student perspective, the exercise manager is used in the following way:<p><ol><li>The students send an exercise start message when they start working on a particular exercise.</li><li>The students send en exercise question message if a problem occurs which requires assistance from a teacher.
     As a variant, a 'total frustration' message can be sent. The students briefly explain the nature of the problem
     in the message field.</li><li>When a group of students get help, they send a message of the type 'got help'. This makes
     the previous question or frustration messages pertaining to a particular exercises disappear
     from the overviews, which are regularly consulated by the teachers.</li><li>An exercise finish question is sent when the students are done with the exercise.
     As a variant, the students can send a 'gave up' message.
     The students are encouraged to explain the outcome of the exercise in the message field.</li></ol><p>We encourage the students to use the exercise manager via the following incentives:<p><ul><li type = "disc">The students cannot ask for help via the system before they have sent a start message.</li><li type = "disc">When the students send a question via the system, a teaching assistant will
     visit the students within a few minutes.</li><li type = "disc">The students get access to a the teacher's solution (via 'opening of a link')
    when they claim successfully to have solved the problems of the exercise.</li></ul><p>From a teacher perspective, the exercise manager helps out in the following ways:<p><ul><li type = "disc">It is possible, at a particular WWW address, to see which groups are active at a given
    point in time. Such an overview is useful in order to plan the visits to the group rooms.</li><li type = "disc">The teacher, who services particular groups, can get a concise overview of the groups who
    need help. Only the latest, non-serviced questions are shown in the overview,
    and only messages from particular groups, to which the teaching assistant is allocated,
    are shown.
    As of now, the teachers use the student's browser to access the list of groups that have asked
    for help. One could alternatively imagine that the teachers would use mobile equipment.</li><li type = "disc">After an exercises session we can generate a status, in which the questions and feedback 
    from the groups can be surveyed. We can also evaluate the waiting times for help, and
    the level of activity in the individual groups.</li></ul><p>The successful use of the exercise manager requires discipline from both the students
  and teachers. One should also be aware that there may be elements of 'big brother
  watches you' using the system. However, the experiences until now is quite
  positive and encouraging. The students experience that they often get help a few minutes
  after a problem is reported. And as a teacher of the course, it is possible to
  get detailed knowledge about the success (or lack of success) of an exercises session.
  Using the messages submitted to the system, it is also possible to plan future modifications
  of the exercise programme, and to spot recurring problems that need to be addressed in a future
  plenum session on the course.<p>Until now, the messages from the exercise manager are one-way, from the students to the teacher.
  As an obvious generalization, one could imagine a two-way communication using the system.
  This would, however, require that one of the teachers operates the system rather than
  visiting the students face to face. We have not yet tried out such an alternative use
  of the teacher resources.<p>The exercise manager was designed to alleviate some concrete problems
  with exercises in many small rooms. We believe, however, that some of
  ideas of synchronous exercise support via the WWW can be used
  in other setting, for instance in more classical lab sessions in
  a distributed environment.</font><p><a name = "idafus"></a><font size = "5" color = "#0000ff">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asynchronous Activity Management</font><br><font color = "#000000">The exercise manager, described in the previous section, is a synchronous tool
  designed to be used by on-campus students.
  We are getting more and more open university students who work off-campus, and who study
  at nights or in weekends. We have recently started to service these students
  with an asynchronous activity management tool, called IDAFUS. IDAFUS 
  share properties with news-group systems and conference systems. In this section 
  we will briefly outline the most interesting properties of this system.<p>The main concepts in IDAFUS are <em>units</em>, <em>activities</em> and <em>contributions</em>. Within a given unit (such as a course) it is possible to define a number of activities
  (such as exercises or discussion forums focussed on particular topics).
  An activity is described in terms of a formulation, a clarification (optional),
  a visibility of the contributions to the activity, and other properties. Contributions can be
  private (between a student and the teacher), visible to a group or class of students,
  or public. The contributions from the students or teachers are organized in a tree,
  rooted in an activity, and hereby allowing that a contribution can follow up on another contribution.
  Each contribution has a type.<p>Contributions in IDAFUS are presented together with a photo of the
  contributing student or teacher. This has turned out to be very important
  in relation to seminars or lectures. Students, who have been using
  the system a lot, are easily recognized during subsequent classes or seminars.<p>IDAFUS provides various customizable overview pages, such that users of the system
  only needs to check a single page in order to find out whether there
  are new contributions of interest.<p>It is important for off-campus student to get feedback on exercises.
  IDAFUS allows 'just in time' solutions, in terms of an automatically released
  contribution from the teacher when the student submits his or her solution.
  The teacher's solution stems from the activity clarification, mentioned above.
  The automatic relase of the solution also makes life easier for the teacher.
  However, it is still important for the teacher to follow up - on an individual basis - on relevant
  contributions from the students.<p>IDAFUS supports serial activities, in the terms of released continuation activities.
  In the current system the serial activities are linear, but on could also imagine some kind
  of branching structure. Serial activities mixed with released solution 
  allows us keep the student 'on track'. In addition, it creates a feeling
  of 'dynamics', which may cause curiosity and extra student attention.<p>Besides the WWW interface to the student, IDAFUS also provides the teacher
  with a friendly WWW interface for activity definition and management.
  From an administrative point of view, we support a basic WWW-based user registration
  subsystem for IDAFUS.</font><p><a name = "integr"></a><font size = "5" color = "#0000ff">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration Issues</font><br><font color = "#000000">The integration of course plan pages (including calendar pages), course
  material pages, and dialogue pages 
  soon becomes a major concern, and a source of complexity. We support the following
  kinds of integration:<p><ul><li type = "disc">Export of temporal information from the course plan system to the LAML calendar tool</li><li type = "disc">Export of exercise information from LENO to the course plan system and the exercise manager</li><li type = "disc">Transfer of link information from the exercise manager to both LENO and the course plan system</li></ul><p>Currently we use very simple means to achieve the necessary integration.
  In a future version one could imagine a more sophisticated integration approach involving a

  the entire system.</font><p><a name = "conclu"></a><font size = "5" color = "#0000ff">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions</font><br><font color = "#000000">We have presented a suite of tools for management of the WWW support
  of a university course in computer science.  Taken as a whole, the tools make it possible
  to produce and maintain a large body of material, which it would be
  almost impossible to manage without tool support.  Our
  material for the object-oriented programming course (using Java)
  consists of approximately 2000 HTML pages, each with a number of internal links, and 
  a considerable amount of links to
  external targets.  The programmatic authoring approach relies on 
  abstractions in order not to deal with unwanted details, and
  automation of routine tasks.  The automation has, for instance, been used to check
  the validity of the link targets at generation time. In addition, we
  have been able to make and maintain several editions of the entire
  lecture note material (including a WWW server edition, a labtop

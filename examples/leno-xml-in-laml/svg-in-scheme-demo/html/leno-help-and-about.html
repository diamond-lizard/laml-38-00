         in a number of chapters (or lectures). The top-level page refers to each lecture
         in the material. Each lecture, in turn, refers to a number of pages.<p>As an important characteristics of LENO, each page can be shown
         in at least three, and depending on the material, possibly four different views:<p><ul><li type = "disc">A slide view</li><li type = "disc">An annotated slide view</li><li type = "disc">An aggregated lecture view</li><li type = "disc">A thematic view</li></ul><p>In  <em>slide view</em>  the primary information on a page is shown using
         a large font, hereby making it attractive to present the information
         from a browser via a projector in an auditorium.<p>In the  <em>annotated slide view</em>  the primary information is shown with
         a number of annotations, which are associated with the individual
         constituents of a slide page. As in slide view, a single page is shown
         in isolation from all other pages, but links to the previous and 
         the next page exists.<p>An  <em>aggregated lecture view</em>  shows the primary slide information
         and the annotations of all pages in a lecture. Thus, in this view, the pages 
         of a lecture are all aggregated into a single 'lecture page'.
         The information contents of this view is the same as the sum of
         the information of the all annotated slides in a single lecture.<p>The  <em>thematic view</em>  typically shows most slide elements, including the annotations,
          with additional interleavning text. Typically, but not necessarily, a theme correspond to a section
          of slides. In the theme view of a material, elements such as programs, images, tables, and exercises are numbered
          hierarchically. Themes are not always present in a LENO-based material. The thematic view of the material
          may be available as PDF files via the 'printer icon'.
          It takes extra efforts by the autor to create a thematic view of the material. Use the yellow T icon to navigate to thematic
          expositions, if they are available.<p>In addition, LENO supports generation of an automatically progressing slide show with the teacher's speaker sound. 
          For this to work, the author needs to record the speaker sound and prepare the sequencing and timing
          of the individual pages in the show.
          An automatically progressing slide show with speaker sound is started from the lecture overview page,
          with one of the small speaker icons or from
          one of the textually anchored links just above the note page table. The slide show brings you through selected slide pages, 
          programs, and image series. Notice that some of the slide pages my be visited more than once (such as before and
          after an external program page or image series - with different speaker sounds). The speaker sound can come from wav of mp3 files.
          If the material is located on a web server, the sound is streamed to 
          your browser, and currently it relies on RealPlayer from  <a href = "http://www.real.com">http://www.real.com</a> . For setup see for instance
           <a href = "http://video.auc.dk/">Aalborg University's video pages</a> .

Using a LENO trail it is
          possible to define a sequence of slides from selected slides in a number of sections. The
          trail determines the selection and the sequence of the slides. This is useful if you want to present
          a subset of your slides for some purpose, and if you do not want to deal with multiple copies (which is usually a bad solution).
          The LENO trail facilities is realized via use of HTML frames. The red icons from above
          are all shown in a frame of its own (in the leftmost margin), the trail navigation frame. Notice that
          you can navigate freely in the slide trail while maintaining the context of the trail.<p>The keyboard shortcuts work in Internet Explorer 4, 5, 6 (from Microsoft), and in 
           Mozilla and Netscape 6.<p>The collection of HTML WWW pages, which constitute a set of lecture notes, are generated from an 
           XML-in-LAML source file, written in the programming language Scheme. Scheme is a language
           in the Lisp family of languages. The LENO surface syntax is generated from an XML Document Type Definition (DTD),
           and as such LENO is tightly connected to XML.

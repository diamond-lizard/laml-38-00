on a Computer. <em>Universal Time</em> refers to a standard which counts the seconds
since January 1, 1900 (midnight, GMT). In this paper we will use another fix point, namely
January 1, 1970. <p>
As an introductory observation, it is worthwhile to notice that the number of 
seconds since January 1, 1970  can is returned by the Scheme function <font color = "#464646"><kbd>current-time</kbd></font> (taking
no parameters) in some Scheme systems (SCM, for instance). The Scheme system gets this
number from the underlying operating system, of course.<p>
As an example, the current time was 948450887 at the moment of when these words were written.
Furthermore
<pre>
  (<a href = "time.html#time-decode" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>time-decode</kbd></font></a> 948450887) = (2000 1 21 10 34 47)
</pre>
See details about <font color = "#464646"><kbd>time-decode</kbd></font> in the next section.
Please be aware of the problems of time zones and daylight saving time, cf. section
<a href = "documentation.html#postscriptum" style = "{text-decoration: underline;}" target = "documentation-frame" title = "Final remarks" ><font color = "#0000ff">3.1</font></a>.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><a name="attack-plan"><table border = 0><tr><td width = 1200 valign = bottom bgcolor = "#00ccff"><a href = "documentation.html#intro-section"><img src = "./images/small-up.gif" alt = "Introduction" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#time-systems"><img src = "./images/small-prev.gif" alt = "Time systems and functions " border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<img src = "./images/small-next-blind.gif" alt = "" border = "0" >  <br> <b><font size = 4>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan of attack</font></b></td></tr></table>We first decide to solve the problem using the functional programming paradigm.
This is natural when we program in a Lisp Dialect. But it is also natural because of
the problem, as defined above, calls for a function with well-defined input and output (and no side effects).
Let us call the overall function <a href = "time.html#time-decode" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>time-decode</kbd></font></a>.<p>
Scheme is weak with respect to static typing
so let us here give the signature of the function:
<font size = "-1">
<pre>
  time-decode: integer -> (year x month x day x hour x minute x second)
</pre>
</font>
The type <font color = "#464646"><kbd>year</kbd></font> represents an integer greater than or equal to 1970, <font color = "#464646"><kbd>month</kbd></font> is the interval [1..12],
<font color = "#464646"><kbd>day</kbd></font> is [1..31], <font color = "#464646"><kbd>hour</kbd></font> is [0..23], and both <font color = "#464646"><kbd>minute</kbd></font> and <font color = "#464646"><kbd>second</kbd></font> belong to [0..59]. 
The vector on the right hand side will be represented as a list in our program. <p>
As a matter of terminology,
the integer at the left hand side of the signature will be called the <em>second counter</em>.
We say that an integer value is <em>T-normalized</em> if it is contained in the interval of type T.
Thus, for instance, the integer 25 is not <em>hour-normalized</em>, but 1 is (leaving us with 24 hours
which can be changed to one extra day).<p>
In the one extreme we can imagine the conversions to be done via a (presumably complicated) formula 
which realizes an efficient <em>calculation</em> of the result, using arithmetic operators.
In the other extreme we can imagine a simple solution based on successive <em>counting</em> and subtracting of
well-defined time intervals such as years (with and without leap days), months (in four variations),
days, and hours from the second counter. This would be a less efficient solution, but if reliability
and trust are emphasized, this will provide for a transparent and easy to follow solution. <p>
In the solution presented in section <a href = "documentation.html#solution-section" style = "{text-decoration: underline;}" target = "documentation-frame" title = "The solution" ><font color = "#0000ff">2</font></a> we will allow "counting",
but for some simple sub-problems we use solutions based on "calculation" with formulas involving simple arithmetic operators.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><a name="solution-section"><table border = 0><tr><td width = 1200 valign = bottom bgcolor = "#00ccff"><a href = "documentation.html#START"><img src = "./images/small-up.gif" alt = "" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#intro-section"><img src = "./images/small-prev.gif" alt = "Introduction" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#final-section"><img src = "./images/small-next.gif" alt = "Post Scriptum" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<br><b><font size = 5>2&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution</font></b><br>In this section we describe the solutions in a number of natural subsection.
First we find the year. The last information we extract is the month.</td></tr></table><table border = 0><tr><td width = 10 valign = top ></td><td width = * valign = top ><font size = 2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#years" target = documentation-frame><font color = "#000000">Dealing with years</font></a></font><br><font size = 2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#days-hours-minutes-seconds" target = documentation-frame><font color = "#000000">Dealing with days, hours, minutes, and seconds</font></a></font><br><font size = 2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#months" target = documentation-frame><font color = "#000000">Dealing with months</font></a></font><br><font size = 2>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#all" target = documentation-frame><font color = "#000000">Putting it all together</font></a></font><br></td></tr></table>&nbsp;<p><a name="years"><table border = 0><tr><td width = 1200 valign = bottom bgcolor = "#00ccff"><a href = "documentation.html#solution-section"><img src = "./images/small-up.gif" alt = "The solution" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<img src = "./images/small-prev-blind.gif" alt = "" border = "0" >&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#days-hours-minutes-seconds"><img src = "./images/small-next.gif" alt = "Dealing with days, hours, minutes, and seconds" border = "0" ></a>  <br> <b><font size = 4>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with years</font></b></td></tr></table>The first subproblem is to find the year represented by the second counter.
We will use the 'count and subtract' approach to find the year. Is is critical that
we deal correctly with leap years. Therefore we start our programming with
a function predicate <a href = "time.html#leap-year" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>leap-year</kbd></font></a> that determines whether a year is a leap year. 
The rule is that y is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, it is not a leap year
if it is divisible by 100, but - as yet an exception - a leap year if it is divisible
by 400. I do not know whether there are more exceptions, but we can be confident that
these will not be relevant in our life time, nor in this program's life time.
Notice, that the most extreme exception listed above is relevant in this year, 2000.<p>
Now the function <a href = "time.html#years-and-seconds" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>years-and-seconds</kbd></font></a> solves the problem. The underlying counting
is an iterative process, which we in Scheme handle by a tail-recursive function.
This function is called <a href = "time.html#cycle-years" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>cycle-years</kbd></font></a>. The "cycling" starts from
<a href = "time.html#base-year" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>base-year</kbd></font></a>. (<a href = "time.html#cycle-years" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>cycle-years</kbd></font></a> n y r) maintains the invariant
<pre>
  n + r = C
</pre>
where C is the start value of r. n is increased and r is decreased by the the number
of seconds in the actual year y. y is increased by one for each iteration.
When the rest r becomes less than the seconds in the
actual year, we return y and the rest seconds (as a list of two elements).<p>
The function <font color = "#464646"><kbd>cycle-years</kbd></font> 
depends on the constants <a href = "time.html#seconds-in-a-leap-year" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>seconds-in-a-leap-year</kbd></font></a> and <a href = "time.html#seconds-in-a-normal-year" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>seconds-in-a-normal-year</kbd></font></a>
which are easily pre-calculated using a pocket calculator.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds"><table border = 0><tr><td width = 1200 valign = bottom bgcolor = "#00ccff"><a href = "documentation.html#solution-section"><img src = "./images/small-up.gif" alt = "The solution" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#years"><img src = "./images/small-prev.gif" alt = "Dealing with years" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#months"><img src = "./images/small-next.gif" alt = "Dealing with months" border = "0" ></a>  <br> <b><font size = 4>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with days, hours, minutes, and seconds</font></b></td></tr></table>Now we have reduced the problem to finding the normalized months,
days, hours, minutes and seconds from a rest second counter <em>r</em>
that is less than the number of seconds in a year. It would be natural
to find the month next, but doing so would call for yet another
<em>counting</em> process, because a month is an irregular time
interval (some months have 31 days, others 30, February has normally
28 days, but there is 29 days in leap years).<p>
It is easy to find the unnormalized number of days, and the normalized
hours, minutes, and seconds from <em>r</em>. This is done by <em>quotient
and modulo calculations</em>. The function
<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds</kbd></font></a> does that. We first find the
(non day-normalized) number of days by dividing the parameter <font color = "#464646"><kbd>n</kbd></font> by
<a href = "time.html#seconds-in-a-day" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>seconds-in-a-day</kbd></font></a> (<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds-@a" target = program-frame><img src = "./images/source-mark-red.gif" alt = "A link to a program source marker in how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" border = "0" ></a><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds-@a">). The remainder, called <font color = "#464646"><kbd>n-rest-1</kbd></font> (<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds-@b" target = program-frame><img src = "./images/source-mark-green.gif" alt = "A link to a program source marker in how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" border = "0" ></a><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds-@b">) is
used to find the hour-normalized number of hours by division of
<font color = "#464646"><kbd>n-rest-1</kbd></font> by <a href = "time.html#seconds-in-an-hour" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>seconds-in-an-hour</kbd></font></a> (<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds-@c" target = program-frame><img src = "./images/source-mark-blue.gif" alt = "A link to a program source marker in how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" border = "0" ></a><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds-@c">).  Again the remainder,
<font color = "#464646"><kbd>n-rest-2</kbd></font> (<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds-@d" target = program-frame><img src = "./images/source-mark-black.gif" alt = "A link to a program source marker in how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" border = "0" ></a><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds-@d">) is found, and this quantum is used to find the
minute-normalized number of minutes (<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds-@e" target = program-frame><img src = "./images/source-mark-maroon.gif" alt = "A link to a program source marker in how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" border = "0" ></a><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds-@e">). Finally the number of
seconds are found in the last modulo calculation (<a href = "time.html#how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds-@f" target = program-frame><img src = "./images/source-mark-grey.gif" alt = "A link to a program source marker in how-many-days-hours-minutes-seconds" border = "0" ></a><a name="days-hours-minutes-seconds-@f">).
We use a sequential name-biding form <font color = "#464646"><kbd>let</kbd></font>* to find the results in a
sequential fashion. Still we are entirely within the functional
paradigm, of course. The function returns the list of days, hours,
minutes, and seconds.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><a name="months"><table border = 0><tr><td width = 1200 valign = bottom bgcolor = "#00ccff"><a href = "documentation.html#solution-section"><img src = "./images/small-up.gif" alt = "The solution" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#days-hours-minutes-seconds"><img src = "./images/small-prev.gif" alt = "Dealing with days, hours, minutes, and seconds" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#all"><img src = "./images/small-next.gif" alt = "Putting it all together" border = "0" ></a>  <br> <b><font size = 4>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with months</font></b></td></tr></table>In section <a href = "documentation.html#days-hours-minutes-seconds" style = "{text-decoration: underline;}" target = "documentation-frame" title = "Dealing with days, hours, minutes, and seconds" ><font color = "#0000ff">2.2</font></a> we almost solved the rest of
the problems. However, we still have to find the month component from
a non day-normalized number of days. As an example, we may have 45
days, which should represent February 14. As another example, day
counter 60 represents February 29 in a leap year, and March 1 in
non-leap years. Thus, we clearly see that we need to take the actual
year into account when finding the normalized months and days from a
day counter.<p>
The function <a href = "time.html#day-and-month" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>day-and-month</kbd></font></a> solves the problem. Like in section
<a href = "documentation.html#years" style = "{text-decoration: underline;}" target = "documentation-frame" title = "Dealing with years" ><font color = "#0000ff">2.1</font></a> we go for a counting solution. This is done by the
tail-recursive helping function <a href = "time.html#day-and-month-help" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>day-and-month-help</kbd></font></a>. A call of
<pre>
 (day-and-month-help n m y c)
</pre>
involves that in year <font color = "#464646"><kbd>y</kbd></font> and month <font color = "#464646"><kbd>m</kbd></font> we are taking
<pre>
  (<a href = "time.html#days-in-month" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>days-in-month</kbd></font></a> m y)
</pre>
days from c and adding a month to m.  The function <a href = "time.html#days-in-month" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>days-in-month</kbd></font></a>
relies on a table of month lengths (for a normal year) called
<a href = "time.html#month-length-normal-year" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>month-length-normal-year</kbd></font></a>. The iteration goes on as long as the rest
days, c, is less than the number of days in the actual month m (in the
year y).<p>
In the function <a href = "time.html#day-and-month" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>day-and-month</kbd></font></a> we pass the expression <font color = "#464646"><kbd>(+ 1
day-count)</kbd></font> to the formal day counter parameter c in
<a href = "time.html#day-and-month-help" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#000080"><kbd>day-and-month-help</kbd></font></a>. The reason is that one day into January brings
us to some point in time at January 2, not January 1.  Thus, because c
will be the day of the month, c can never be 0. In the tail-recursive
call, we know that c > (days-in-month m y), thus ensuring this
property recursively.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><a name="all"><table border = 0><tr><td width = 1200 valign = bottom bgcolor = "#00ccff"><a href = "documentation.html#solution-section"><img src = "./images/small-up.gif" alt = "The solution" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<a href = "documentation.html#months"><img src = "./images/small-prev.gif" alt = "Dealing with months" border = "0" ></a>&nbsp;<img src = "./images/small-next-blind.gif" alt = "" border = "0" >  <br> <b><font size = 4>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting it all together</font></b></td></tr></table>We have now solved all parts of the problem, and we need to put them together.

may cause problems for the time conversion. Being in a specific time zone, 
or going from normal "winter time" to daylight saving time does probably
not change the second counter in the computer. Consequently, we need to 
take corrective actions in the program in order to return the right time from the conversion function .<p>
The easiest counter measure is to add or subtract an hour (3600 seconds) in <a href = "time.html#time-decode" target = "program-frame" title = "time" style = "{text-decoration: none;}" ><font color = "#ff0000"><kbd>time-decode</kbd></font></a>
just after the parameter n (the second counter) has been passed as parameter.<p>
This concludes the time conversion example.<p>
It would be possible - and natural - to continue the example with the reverse transformation,
by calculation of the weekday, and by transformation of time intervals. Most of these can

      <p>
         This is a test of UTF-8. It should be used with a Unicode based Scheme system, such
         as MzScheme 300+. Notice the setting of the variable laml-character-encoding,
         which affects the encoding attribute of the xml declaration of the document.
         Be sure to switch to UTF-8 encoding before saving the text file. </p>
      <p>Here are the Danish characters. Upper case: &#198;&#216;&#197;. Lower case: &#230;&#248;&#229;.</p>
      <p>Here are some German characters: ä, ü, ß.</p>
      <p>
         The use of LAML&#39;s HTML character transformation table is not necessary to obtain these.
         If, however, we want to make use of HTML&#39;s symbolic representation of special
         characters, the HTML character transformation table can be used to obtain
         this. </p>

<html><head><title>Escaping</title></head> <body><p>Normally you will have to use special character entities to
         render the characters &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39;.</p> <p>But not in LAML! It would compromise the HTML validation if the author could write
         HTML tags as CDATA. We have choosen to show &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; for face value in
         documents generated by LAML. LAML has to convert &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; to the underlying
         character entities. This is done via use of <a href = "../../man/laml.html#html-char-transformation-table">html-char-transformation-table</a>,
         which is located in laml.scm.</p> <p>On the side, we have to escape the text quote character &quot; in LAML. This is done
         by Scheme&#39;s escaping conventions, of course.</p></body></html>

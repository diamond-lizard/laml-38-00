The full version contains a lot of documentation together with
         the Scheme software. The latter only contains the software and minimal documentation with links to the www.auc.dk stuff.<p></li><li>Both LENO, the course plan facility, and the Scheme Elucidator now creates the internal directories, if they do not exist already<p></li><li>A new LAML activation command called absolute-laml has been introduced, but only supported on solaris on unix using MzScheme.
         The absolute-laml command activates a laml file addressed by an absolute path, as opposed to activating LAML on a file
         in the current directory. I use absolute-laml for cron job activation of LAML programs.<p></li><li>A little more work has been done on the LAML bibtex tool, but it is still not complete.<p></li><li>The Emacs mode for LAML has been improved such that the LAML keybindings (C-o, etc) are now local to the laml keymap.
         Menu support for LAML has also been added (in 16.1).<p></li><li>The general library has been reorganized to provide for better categorization of the generally useful functions
         in the LAML software packages.<p></li><li>LAML now supports a <em>LAML init file</em>, such as <kbd>.laml</kbd> in the users home directory. The laml init file is loaded as the
         last action in <kbd>laml.scm</kbd>. The laml init file is for your own customization of LAML. Please notice that redefinition 
         of functions loaded by LAML styles and tools cannot be done in the LAML init file, because such stuff is loaded
         after the loading of <kbd>laml.scm</kbd>. The LAML init file is specified in an optional clause of the <kbd>configuration</kbd> file of LAML, cf. 
         the<a href = "../info/laml-easy-installation.html">LAML installation guide</a>.<p></li></ol><p><em>Besides the major improvemens listed above, a lot of small improvements have been made throughout the styles, tools, and libraries. 
        See a  <a href = "version-15-to-16.txt">more detailed log</a>  for further details. Notice however that some changes has been performed
        without any logging...</em><p><p><p>As can be seen, version 16 does not contain major new features. However, a lot of small additions and corrections have been made - enough
    to warrant a new distribution.<p>&nbsp;<p><p>Kurt Nørmark <br> Aalborg University <br> normark@cs.auc.dk</td></tr></table>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font size = "1" color = "#ff0000">Generated: February 4, 2002, 15:23:59</font></body></html>

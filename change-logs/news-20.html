      <h1>What is new in LAML</h1>
      <h3>News in version 20:</h3>
      <ol>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <b>
               XML-in-LAML: The major good news in this release is that the Scheme mirrors of
               XML languages are now fully validating in relation to the XML DTD. Based
               on the parsed content models from the XML DTD we automatically generate deterministic
               final automata that checks the LAML documents. This affects XHTML,
               SVG, LENO, and a number of other XML mirrors in LAML. If you make a Scheme mirror
               of you own XML language, you will take immediate advange of this
               too. The automata are supported by a new
               <a href="../lib/man/final-state-automaton.html">
                  final state automation library
               </a>
               in LAML.
            </b>
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            For illustrative purposes, this full distribution includes the XHTML1.0 transitional
            DTD in the directory
            <kbd>tools/dtd-parser/sample-dtd/</kbd>
            together with a script that parses it. In the directory
            <kbd>tools/xml-in-laml/sample-mirror-generation/</kbd>
            we provide a script that generates the fully validating XML-in-LAML
            mirror of XHTML1.0 transitional.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            LAML now support of both guile and mzscheme on linux. Configure LAML with laml-platform
            unix and operating-system linux.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            XML-in-LAML: Attributes are now output in the same way as the document contents.
            In earlier versions an attribute list of an element was aggregated
            as a string before being transferred to the output (a string or an open output
            port).
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            XML-in-LAML: Characters in XML attribute values are now &#39;protected&#39; in the same
            way as the textual contents. More concretly, the characters &#39;&lt;&#39;, &#39;&gt;&#39;,
            &#39;&amp;&#39;, single quote, and double quote characters are converted to appropriate character
            entities. As in ealier versions, this is done by means of the
            <a href="../man/laml.html#html-char-transformation-table">
               HTML character transformation table
            </a>.
             This is primarily of interest for XHTML, of course.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            XML-in-LAML: The pp option in write-html has been improved. Now the pretty printing
            is done directly on the LAML AST, in a way closely connected with
            raw output. In practical terms it means that XHTML and SVG can now be rendered
            and pretty printed with a better result, and much faster than in earlier
            versions of LAML. I am quite happy with the result. Take a look at
            the source of this HTML file for an example.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The collect-skip library in lib/ has been extended such that it is possible to take
            input from a string. Earlier, it was only possible to read input from
            an open input port.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            dtd-parser-4.scm in tools/dtd-parser/: Much inproved parsing of content models of
            XML DTDs.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            Some LAML users have complained about the Emacs key bindings made by LAML. As a
            consequence it is now possible to avoid LENO and Scheme Elucidator
            support (and hereby a bunch of key bindings). Two new boolean options
            have been introduced in laml-config/configuration: 
            <kbd>leno-emacs-support</kbd>
            and
            <kbd>elucidator-emacs-support</kbd>.
            In addition, the LAML configuration program now tells new the LAML user
            how to affect the key bindings.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            XML-in-LAML: A new form
            <kbd>(char-ref x)</kbd>
            represents character references in XML-in-LAML documents. As an example,
            
            <kbd>(char-ref &quot;amp&quot;)</kbd>
            is rendered as
            <b><kbd>&amp;amp;</kbd></b>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            In some Scheme systems it is awkward to implement the LAML compatibility function
            <kbd>sort-list</kbd>,
            which sorts a list. The sorting functions from
            <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/SLIB">SLIB</a>,
            located in
            <kbd>lib/compatibility/sorting/</kbd>
            solves this problem.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The older pieces of LAML software has been identified, and factored out from the
            main table, as presented on the LAML software home page.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The Scheme Elucidator can now process Scheme programs with vector constants.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <a href="../index.html#which-scheme">Detailed notes</a>
            have beend added about the individual Scheme systems, platforms, and operating systems
            on which LAML is supported. We also provide some
            <a href="../info/timing.html">run time measures</a>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            LAML has been tested with SCM 57d on Linux. Overall, it works very well.

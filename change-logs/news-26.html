      <h1>What is new in LAML</h1>
      <h3>News in version 26:</h3>
      <p>
         LAML has been tested positively with MzScheme version 299 on Windows (2000). However
         see the
         <a href="../info/notes/mzscheme-300-windows.html">notes about MzScheme 299</a>.
          If you use this new version of PLT, you should configure LAML as mzscheme-300.
         There is also now (partial) support of LAML in Gambit (see
         <a href="../info/notes/gambit.html">Gambit notes</a>
         ). 
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            Mirror generation: It is now possible to generate mirror functions named with a
            given prefix. It is also possible the generate a mirror in which the
            functions are only available through the language map. See new configuration
            variables in tools/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm. The impact on SchemeDoc
            manuals is still pending.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            XML-in-LAML: It is now possible to eliminate duplicate attributes in an XML attribute
            list (represented as a property list). This is configured in the mirror
            generation tool. The function xml-duplicated-attribute-handling, which
            takes a language parameter, returns the processing mode.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The new macros
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#with-xml-language">
               with-xml-language
            </a>
            and
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#with-xml-language">
               with-xml-language!
            </a>
            in lib/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm allow the author to focus exclusively on document
            generation in single XML language. With use of this macro, name clashes
            with other XML languages are avoided. This is very helpful if you, in
            a distinguished part of your program, make use a mirror which overlaps
            with other mirrors.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The semantics of the function
            <a href="../man/laml.html#optional-parameter">optional-parameter</a>
            has been changed slightly. It is now possible to pass a value that serves as a
            <em>non passed value</em>,
            hereby asking to use the default value of the parameter.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            LAML now assumes that the Scheme reader is case sensitive. More specifically,
            a case sensitive Scheme reader turns out to be the best solution for XML languages
            that rely on case sensitivity. If you do not deal with case sensitive
            XML DTDs, you can still use a standard non-cases sensitive R5RS Scheme
            system for LAML. We arrange for case sensitivity in the Scheme compatibility
            files in
            <kbd>lib/compatibility/</kbd>.
            MzSchme 200+ and Guile are setup to be case sensitive in the LAML compatibility
            files.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The LAML DTD parser is now able to handle conditional sections of the DTD. With
            this it is possible to parse the SVG1.1 DTD and the XHTML1.1 DTD.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            SchemeDoc: A new front-matters option allows for alphabetic sorting of XML attributes.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            Via redefinition of the function
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/man/xml-in-laml.html#extraordinary-allow-element?">
               <kbd>extraordinary-allow-element?</kbd>
            </a>
            from
            <kbd>lib/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm</kbd>
            it is now possible to allow a certain element to appear within another element.
            This introduces a hook into the XML validation apparatus. Motivation:
            Sometimes it is useful to allow certain elements within an XHTML context,
            which are eventually transformed to XHTML.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The Scheme Elucidator 2 has been extended to support multiple source file versions.
            This is a significant update and improvement of this tool. See an
            <a href="../examples/elucidator-2/versions/version-demo.html">example</a>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <p>
               LAML SchemeDoc now supports a boolean attribute,
               <kbd>scheme-source-linking</kbd>.
               With use of this attribute it is possible to link from a SchemeDoc manual, which
               is extracted from a Scheme source program, to a rendering of the
               Scheme source program itself. The documentation of most LAML libraries
               make use of this new feature.
               <a href="../lib/man/general.html#as-string">Example</a>
               (follow link of &#39;Scheme source file&#39;).
            </p>
            <p>
               The Scheme source program itself provides for rich linking, both internally
               and externally. The Scheme source program HTML page is created via the Scheme
               Elucidator. With this new feature, the integration of SchemeDoc and
               the Scheme Elucidator has been made more complete. Recall, in this
               context, that the Scheme Elucidator already is able to link from Scheme
               source files to SchemeDoc resources.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            LENO: The element syntax has been renamed to language-syntax. In Guile, it gives
            problem to (re)define the name syntax.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            A new XML-in-LAML style,
            <a href="../styles/xml-in-laml/chords/man/chords.html">LAML Chords</a>,
            has been added. With this style, you can write simple song text, and annotate it
            with chords. 
            <a href="../examples/chords/index.html">Examples</a>.
             The LAML chords system outputs an HTML file, in which the chords are
            placed above song lines. As a convenient facility, the LAML chords system
            is able to automatically transpose a song from one key to another. The
            LAML Chords facility comes with a set of supporting Emacs commands.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The emacs support stuff in the directory
            <kbd>emacs-support/</kbd>
            has been reorganized a bit. The file
            <kbd>laml-template.el</kbd>
            has been included in
            <kbd>laml-mode.el</kbd>.
            This simplifies the organization of the LAML Emacs stuff. In addition, your
            <kbd>.emacs</kbd>
            file will now load the file
            <kbd>emacs-support/laml-emacs-support.el</kbd>
            (instead of
            <kbd>emacs-support/dot-emacs-support.el</kbd>
            ). If you have an old LAML installation, you will need to delete the loading of
            <kbd>emacs-support/dot-emacs-support.el</kbd>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            LAML emacs support: We have added an Emacs command,
            <b>M-x insert-relative-file-path</b>,
            which is useful for insertion of file paths, which are relative to the
            current directory. Use this command when you link from one (HTML) file
            to another. The command
            <b>insert-relative-file-path</b>
            is probably useful in many non-LAML contexts as well. You find insert-relative-file-path
            in
            <kbd>emacs-support/laml-mode.el</kbd>
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            <a href="../lib/xml-in-laml/mirrors/man/xhtml11-mirror.html">XHTML1.1</a>
            is now supported by LAML.
            <a href="../examples/xhtml11/index.html">Examples</a>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The Emacs customization facility for LAML has been updated. Some old stuff has been
            deleted. Try
            <b>M-x laml-customize</b>
            in Emacs.
         </li>
      </ol>

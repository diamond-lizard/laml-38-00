In particular, all the nice and high level stuff from the old <a href = "../lib/html.scm">html.scm</a> library (which is now obsolete for new developments)
                     has been retrofitted to the new mirror. You find the new library in <a href = "../lib/html4.0-loose/convenience.scm">convenience.scm</a> <a href = "../lib/html4.0-loose/man/convenience.html">(manual)</a><p></li><li>The HTML4.0 mirror in LAML now support CSS inline style attributes side by side with HTML attributes, such as:<pre>(em 'css:letter-spacing "0.3cm" 'css:text-decoration "overline" 'css:background-color "yellow"
    'css:color "red" "Emphasized text")</pre><p></li><li>The LAML distribution includes an HTML version of <a href = "../html-doc/html401/cover.html">W3's HTML definitions</a>. We link systematically
                from the <a href = "../lib/html4.0-loose/man/surface.html#html">HTML4.0 mirror manaul pages</a> to this document.<p></li><li>The compatibility files, which implement a number of Scheme definitions for particular Scheme systems, are now moved
                to <a href = "../lib/compatibility/">the compatibility directory of lib</a>. In that way these particular files are
                easier to deal with.<p></li><li>We have included a useful <a href = "../lib/laml-lib-browser.html">browser of all LAML library functions</a>.<p></li><li>We have included a convenient <a href = "../r4rs/r4rs-browser.html">browser for the Scheme Report</a>, R4RS, in the distribution. Our contribution is only
                indexing. The LAML distribution includes an HTML version of R4RS. The <a href = "../styles/elucidator/man/elucidator.html">Scheme Elucidator</a> uses this support too (see the brown links in <a href = "../examples/elucidator/time/time.html">example</a>).<p></li><li>The <a href = "../tools/schemedoc/man/schemedoc.html">SchemeDoc tool</a>, which is able to extract WWW interface documentation from a Scheme source file, has been extended with
                the <a href = "../tools/schemedoc/man/schemedoc.html#SECTION1">support of internal tags</a> - much along the lines of JavaDoc. In that way it is possible to extract well structured manual
                pages directory from a Scheme source file. Allmost all the LAML manuals are produced by Schemedoc.<p></li><li>The <a href = "../lib/cgi.scm">CGI library</a> <a href = "../lib/man/cgi.html">(manual)</a> , together with the library <a href = "../lib/encode-decode.scm">encode-decode</a> <a href = "../lib/man/encode-decode.html">(manual)</a>, now supports file uploading.<p></li><li>The <a href = "../styles/lecture-notes/man/lecture-notes.html">LENO</a> facility  - for production of slides and lecture notes (see <a href = "../slides/lugm-99-amsterdam/html/lugm99.html">example</a>) - now uses the exact HTML4.0 mirror.<p></li><li>The <a href = "../tools/photo-show/man/photo-show.html">photo show tool</a> makes it possible to generate HTML pages for a photo show which cycles automatically through a series of jpg or gif pictures.
                 See the <a href = "../examples/photo-show/index.html">example</a>.<p></li></ol><p><em>Besides the major improvemens listed above, a lot of small improvements have been made throughout the styles, tools, and libraries. 
        See a  <a href = "version-13-to-14.txt">more detailed log</a>  for further details. Notice however that some changes has been performed
        without any logging...</em><p><p><p>&nbsp;<p><p>Kurt Nørmark <br> Aalborg University <br> normark@cs.auc.dk</td></tr></table>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font size = "1" color = "#ff0000">Generated: March 26, 2002, 12:58:06</font></body></html>

        It is now easier to install LAML than in version 14.<p></li><li>The LAML systems has been extended with an <a href = "../tools/xml-html-support/man/html-support.html">HTML parser</a> and a <em>simple</em> <a href = "../tools/xml-html-support/man/xml-support.html">XML parser</a>. Both of these
        are non-validating and generic. It means that they do not depend on any DTD information. 
        The result of the parsers are LISP abstract syntax trees (see the XML parser for information about
        the <a href = "../tools/xml-html-support/man/xml-support.html#SECTION1">format</a>).  
        The procedures <a href = "../man/laml.html#html-parse">html-parse</a> and <a href = "../man/laml.html#xml-parse">xml-parse</a> are convenient high-level commands that allow you
        to parse HTML files and XML files. <p>
        The HTML and XML parsers are still young, and there could be minor errors and inconveniences if you use them.
        I intend to use the XML parser for future XML interfaces to some LAML styles and tools.
        We provide both <a href = "../examples/xml-parser-and-pretty-printer/index.html">XML examples</a> and <a href = "../examples/html-parser-and-pretty-printer/index.html">HTML examples</a>.<p></li><li>The procedure <a href = "../man/laml.html#html-to-laml">html-to-laml</a> transforms an HTML file to the similar LAML file.
        This can be used as the first step in a (mainly manual) re-engineering procedure for conversion of HTML
        files to LAML.<p></li><li>Together with the parsers mentioned above, there is an <a href = "../tools/xml-html-support/man/html-support.html#SECTION2">HTML pretty printer</a> and an <a href = "../tools/xml-html-support/man/xml-support.html#SECTION4">XML pretty printer</a>. Both pretty print
        the syntax trees produced by the parsers described above.  
        The procedures <a href = "../man/laml.html#html-pp">html-pp</a> and <a href = "../man/laml.html#xml-pp">xml-pp</a> are high level pretty printing command that are easy to use.
        The examples from above also
        illustrate the pretty printing capabilities (<a href = "../examples/html-parser-and-pretty-printer/index.html">HTML</a>, <a href = "../examples/xml-parser-and-pretty-printer/index.html">XML</a>)<p></li><li>A parser and pretty printer for <a href = "../tools/bibtex/man/bibtex.html">bibtex</a> has been included. Bibtex is the bibliographic support for LaTeX.
        As of now, the bibtex pretty printer
        is still incomplete. The <a href = "../man/laml.html#bibtex">bibtex</a> procedure is a convenient
        high level way of activating the bibtex support in LAML.  Please also consult the <a href = "../examples/bibtex/index.html">bibtex examples</a>.
        I use this stuff to handle my CV and other matters that require access
        to my bibtex file.<p></li><li>There is a new <a href = "../lib/man/scheme-pretty-printing.html">Scheme pretty printer</a> in LAML. It can be used as a general pretty printer of
        Lisp files. However, there is particular support for the Scheme special forms.
        The <a href = "../man/laml.html#scheme-pp">scheme-pp</a> procedure of the general LAML setup facility is a convenient high-level procedure
        for pretty printing of Scheme and Lisp files. This procedure preserves semicolon comments.
        The variant <a href = "../man/laml.html#scheme-pp-simple">scheme-pp-simple</a> does not preserve such comments.
        Therefore it is simpler, and it should
        be preferred for pretty printing of complicated Lisp expressions, such as syntax trees from the HTML
        and XML parsers.
        <p></li><li>The Emacs command <b><kbd>M-x run-laml-interactively</kbd></b> starts a Scheme interpreter from Emacs which - as the first thing -
        automatically loads the fundamental LAML support. Thus, in such as set up, you can immediately 
        use the most fundamental LAML stuff.<p></li><li>The Emacs command M-x unembed is a natural inverse operation of embed. These
        two Emacs commands are very important for easy and secure authoring of LAML material from Emacs.
        The unembed command is new. Both are described in the <a href = "../index.html#emacs-support">Emacs support overview</a> of the overall index file.<p></li><li>If you use LAML from outside Emacs there is now a <a href = "../index.html#starting-laml-non-emacs">simplified way of loading LAML into your scheme system</a>.<p></li><li>Please also notice the new paper on LAML: <b><em>A Programmatic Approach to WWW Authoring using Functional Programming</em></b> (<a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/laml/papers/programmatic-approach.ps">postscript</a>, <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/laml/papers/programmatic-approach.pdf">pdf</a>) which is available from the <a href = "http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/laml/">LAML home page</a>.<p></li></ol><p><em>Besides the major improvemens listed above, a lot of small improvements have been made throughout the styles, tools, and libraries. 
        See a  <a href = "version-14-to-15.txt">more detailed log</a>  for further details. Notice however that some changes has been performed
        without any logging...</em><p><p><p>&nbsp;<p><p>Kurt Nørmark <br> Aalborg University <br> normark@cs.auc.dk</td></tr></table>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font size = "1" color = "#ff0000">Generated: March 26, 2002, 12:57:32</font></body></html>

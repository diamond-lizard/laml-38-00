It is not known yet if we will be able to make distributions on the future hardware at <kbd>cs.aau.dk</kbd>. It is kind of sad to witness the transition from a very flexible setup on Linux, with web directories at <kbd>~/.public_html/</kbd>, to the world of Microsoft software...</p> <ol><li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">Some development has been done on <a href="http://www.cs.aau.dk/~normark/midi-laml/index.html">MIDI LAML</a> the last year. MIDI LAML is still work in progress. This part of LAML is not yet final, and not necessarily stable. MIDI LAML is more tightly connected to MzScheme version 209 than the rest of the LAML software.</li> <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">A number of other, minor changes have been done at several places in LAML.</li></ol> <p><em>As of May 2011, I use LAML for many everyday WEB tasks. All my HTML files are authored in LAML. I also still use LAML for course home pages (via a special XML language) and for authoring teaching materials (in LENO). However, things change also here. Moodle will be the future E-learning platform at cs.aau.dk. I also work regularly on MIDI LAML, which supports editing of MIDI files in an XML-in-LAML language.</em></p></body></html>

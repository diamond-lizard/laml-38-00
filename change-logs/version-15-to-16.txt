15.3.01 
index-download-bundle.laml
The variable slim-version controls whether a slim version is prepared for.
If #t, almost all links in the distribution are directed towards the distribution/laml directory 
at www.auc.dk.

Leno and the elucidiator now makes the html and internal directories if they do not exists.
I did this to make it easier to distribute 'source-only' examples.

16.3.01
A slim version of the LAML distribtion has been prepared for.
Version 16 of the distribution will be offered in two versions.

3.4.01.
The command file absolute-laml has been introduced in the LAML configuration part.
absolute-laml is an alternative to the laml command file. absolute-laml takes, as
the first parameter, an absolute path to the directory in which the laml file is 
processed:

  absolute-laml absoute-path laml-file-without-extension.

absolute-laml is good for cron job activation of LAML.
The absolute-laml support is not yet supported on all platforms.

30.4.01
surface.scm: New helping function free-html-element which is useful for generating
mirrors of non-standard HTML tags. Example:

  (free-html-element "xyz" 'href "aaa" "bbb" "ccc") =>
  "<xyz href = \"aaa\" >bbb ccc</xyz>"


30.4.01
xml-support.scm: 

  The function parse-tree-to-laml-expression transforms an XML/HTML parse tree to a list structure.
  The function is-tag-of-kind? is a higher-order function that generates a predicate on parse tree nodes
  of a certain kind.

  Example in concert with the existing function traverse-and-collect-from-parse-tree:

    (traverse-and-collect-from-parse-tree resulting-parse-tree (is-tag-of-kind? 'a) parse-tree-to-laml-expression) 
 
  We traverse resulting-parse-tree, extracts all a elements (anchor tag applications) and 
  transforms these to LAML expressions.


1.5.01
  
  convenience: a new table function, called table-5, that allows individual coloring of table cells.

May 01

  The function parse-html-string parses a string of HTML, returning a LAML parse tree.
  The functions done until now parses a file. parse-html-string is a simple work around, which
  just writes, parses, and deletes a temporary file.

6.6.01

  We have added the url-read.scm library, which is a MzScheme dependent facility for reading and crawling
  Internet pages. This is an ad hoc facility, which by no means is finished and final. But it is useful
  and interesting as a simple facility for programmatic access to part of the Internet from MzScheme.

-.7.01  general.scm
  The list-part function has been added to general.scm

9.7.01:  tools/bibtex.scm
  bibtex-book-present has been defined.

10.7.01  course-plan.scm:
  The course plan style now supports automatic creation of auxilary directories: html, html/images, and
  internal.

10.7.01  emacs support:
  The C-o, C-i, and C-x C-e, and C-x C-r commands are now local to laml-mode.

11.7.01  general.scm
  The general library has been re-organized to provide for better categorization of the generally useful functions
  in the LAML software packages.

6.8.01  laml startup and configuration
  LAML now supports a laml init file, such as .laml. 
  The laml init file is loaded as the last action in laml.scm.
  The full path of the laml init file must be specified in the laml configuration file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 16.01

One of the messages from the LAML installation about absolute-laml was changed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 16.02

An error in manual.scm (observed in the slim version only!!!) was corrected.
Use of capitalize-string-nd instead of capitalize-string.

color.scm: Defined rgb-color-list as an alias of rgb-color strings.
Manual improvements of color.scm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 16.1

Emacs LAML mode: 

  * Now menu entries for the most important commands.
  * Customization support has been added.


convenience.scm
  The variable _ is defined to boolean false (space supression).

laml.scm:
  The function full-source-path-with-extension has been added to laml.scm


-.0.01:
Leno has been revised.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 16.2

27.8.01:
The function embed-substring has been added to general.scm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.9.01:
An important addition to the HTML4.0 loose surface mirror:

From LAML version 16.2 contents-i (i from 1 to n) can also be proper
lists of strings which automatically are string-appended to form a
single content string. The attribute names must be symbols, and the
attribute values have to be strings.

Example:

  (ul (map li (list "First element" "Second Element" "Third Element")))
  
is OK in the new mirror. The new idea is to allow ul (one of the mirror tags)
to receive a list of elements, not just a string. In the old mirror you had to write

  (ul (apply string-append 
    (map li (list "First element" "Second Element" "Third Element"))))

or apply one of the convenience functions, such as ul-1

  (ul-1 (list (list "First element" "Second Element" "Third Element")))

which did the job.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The higher order function

  (modify-element element . attributes-and-contents)

has been added to surface.scm in lib/html4.0-loose/.
With this function you can partially fix a number of attribute (and in fact also
part of the contents of a tag). Example:

  (define ol-roman
     (modify-element ol 'css:list-style-type "lower-roman" 'css:background-color "yellow"))

The ol-roman 'tag' will always use roman numbers and yellow background.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.9.01:

laml-error in general has been made.

A trivial version of numeric-string? from lib/html4.0-loose/basis.scm
has been removed. It erronous redefined numeric-string? from lib/general.scm.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.09.01:

The higher order function curry-generalized has been added to the general library
in lib.

This function allows ad hoc currying of functions such as map and filter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19.09.01 LAML Program parameters:

laml.scm
 new: laml-program-parameters
 fake-startup-parameters
 set-laml-startup-directory
 set-laml-source-file
 set-laml-program-parameters  (new)
 language-preference should, per default, be english!!

compatibility (win2000 + unix)
  fake-startup-parameters
  laml-canonical-command-line

  * remember other compatibility files *


styles/simple-html4.0-loose.scm
  generic-page changed.

examples/processing added

This mirror is very accurate in relation to the HTML 4.0 defintion,
         because it is based on parsed version of the HTML4.0 (loose) DTD. We support a 100% accurate attribute check, but not yet
         context free syntactical validation of HTML.
         We include a <a href = "../lib/html4.0-loose/man/basis.html">basic mirror</a> and a convenient and flexible <a href = "../lib/html4.0-loose/man/surface.html">surface 
         layer</a> in this distribution. What is still missing is a reimplementation of the library <a href = "../lib/man/html.html">html.scm</a> to use
         the new bottom layer.<p><li>Programmatic activation of LAML from Scheme has been improved, cf. the functions <kbd>laml</kbd> and <kbd>laml-load</kbd> in <a href = "../man/laml.html#SECTION5">laml.scm</a>.
         We do not use poor activation mode any longer. Now, any activation of LAML uses the contextual information about
         file name and directory path.<p></ol><p>&nbsp;<p><p>Kurt Nørmark <br> Aalborg University <br> normark@cs.auc.dk</td></tr></table>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p><font size = 1 color = "#ff0000">Generated: 26. Marts 2002, 12:58:29</font></body> </html>

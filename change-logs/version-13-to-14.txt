* The function copyright-clause is moved from the general library to laml.scm in the LAML root.

* The variable language-preference and the function text-choice have been moved from the 
  general library to laml.scm in the LAML root.

* The function date-time in lib/time.scm has been refined to give better displays of
  the year 2000 dates. Also, it takes the variable language-preference into account.

* The library lib/html4.0-loose/convenience.scm now corresponds to lib/html.scm.
  convenience.scm uses the accurate html4.0-loose mirror as basis.

* In lib/html4.0-loose/basis.scm (and the tool that generates it, in particular):
  We now support css inline style attributes side by side with ordinary attributes.
  Example:
      (em 'css:letter-spacing "0.3cm" 'css:text-decoration "overline" 'css:background-color "yellow"
          'css:color "red" "Emphasized text")

* laml.scm: Support of URL and anchor tag to the relative or absolute LAML home page (Aalborg University).
  Relevant function: laml-home-button.
  This is based on the function directory-level-difference in the lib/general.scm library.

* We have moved the Scheme compatibility files from lib to lib/compatibility. We have also
  changed the naming of compatibility files from
     <scheme-system>.scm 
  to
     <laml-platform>_<operating-system>_<scheme-system>.scm 

* The style function in laml.scm has been supplied with an optional style-base directory parameter.

* A browser of the R4RS Scheme Report has been included. Likewise, a browser of the LAML libraries
  now constitute a good alternative to the master index.

* Schemedoc now accepts internal and specialized tags for structure documentation of 
  parameters, pre-condition, etc. See the manual page of Schemedoc for details.
  In that way it is possible to use the full expressive
  power of the manual style via Schemdoc. Recall that Schemedoc is the tool which extracts
  particular comments from a Scheme program. Schemdoc transfers this information to the 
  the manaual tool, which presents it on a WWW page. Most LAML manuals are produced by SchemeDoc.

* The CGI library now supports file uploading.

* The following libraries are new in the distribution: string-make-up.scm, crypt.scm, collect-skip.scm.
  The collect-skip library is essential for the file uploading mentioned above.

* LENO (The Lecture Note System) has been converted to the HTML4.0 libraries.

* The directory html-doc contains a copy of the html4.01 documentation.
  The file html-map.scm maps tag names to partial URLs in the HTML documentation.
  This is used in the LAML basic and surface libraries to link to the full HTML documentation.

* laml.scm:  There is a name clash between the LAML style loading function and the
  HTML mirror function style. To remedy this, laml-style is now an alias of the style loading
  function.

* A photo show style has been added.

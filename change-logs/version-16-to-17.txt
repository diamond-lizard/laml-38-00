Fall 01: We have introduced a new validating HTML mirror in LAML. This is the
main LAML in version 17.

The LAML library browser has been extend with the definitions from laml.scm.
Be aware that no LAML document style functions are documented in the LAML browser.

Fall 01.
There is a new procedure write-html in laml.scm which is intended for rendering
and writing of all HTML document to text files.

Feb 12, 2002
The rendering of AST-based documents (using the validating mirrors)
has been made more efficient, using an imperative tree traversal which causes
only minimal garbage collection. When used from write-html, the document is
rendered directly to an output stream.

The standard prolog contains document type declaration.
A new section of functions (prolog and epilog) added to laml.scm.
The procedure write-html has been extended to use the prolog and epilog stuff.

      <h1>What is new in LAML</h1>
      <p>
         Version 22 was never officially released, so I decided to bring all the recent changes
         out as version 23.
      </p>
      <h3>News in version 23:</h3>
      <ol>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            It is now possible to use numbers and characters as element contents items. Change
            processing mode with
            <kbd>(set-xml-accept-extended-contents-in language value)</kbd>.
             It is also possible to affect the possible attribute values. Change
            processing mode with
            <kbd>(set-xml-accept-only-string-valued-attributes-in language value)</kbd>.
             The XHTML LAML templates now makes it easy to use the various LAML processing
            options via the introduction of the a new LAML template &#39;
            <b>Processing options</b>
            &#39; in the LAML Emacs menu. 
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The reporting of errors in case of XML validation problems has been improved. As
            part of the error messages, problematic document fragments are reported using Scheme
            syntax. Earlier, native XML syntax was used.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The Emacs keybindings are now available in two different versions. The
            <kbd>original</kbd>
            keybindings are still maintained. A new set of keybindings, called
            <kbd>hygienic</kbd>
            keybindings, has been introduced. Most of these start with C-c (control
            C). As such, they do not conflict with existing and important Emacs
            keybindings. The choice of keybindings can be controlled in the LAML
            configuration file laml-config/configuration via the configuration property called
            <kbd>emacs-keybindings</kbd>.
            It is also possible to configure LAML without Emacs keybindings, by using
            the value
            <kbd>none</kbd>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            The internal document representation now exists in two version:
            <kbd>laml</kbd>
            and
            <kbd>sxml</kbd>.
             Use of
            <kbd>sxml</kbd>
            is still experimental (but it works well throughout all LAML software). The
            choice of representation is made in
            <kbd>lib/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm</kbd>
            via the variable
            <kbd>laml-internal-representation</kbd>.
            In a future version, the choice of internal representation may be a
            configuration option.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            It is now possible to get access to the element content models, the action
            procedures, and the validation procedures through the a number of new maps in
            <kbd>lib/xml-in-laml/xml-in-laml.scm</kbd>.
            The procedure
            <kbd>validate-ast!</kbd>
            does explicit validation of an AST. In normal use of LAML, the XML validation
            is integrated into the mirror functions. If the AST is not created through
            the mirror functions it is useful to apply the procedure 
            <kbd>validate-ast!</kbd>
            for full XML validation.
            Similarly the procedure
            <kbd>process-ast!</kbd>
            processes an AST by means of the designated action procedures. Notice
            that the mirror libraries will have to be loaded in order to use
            <kbd>validate-ast!</kbd>
            and 
            <kbd>process-ast!</kbd>.
            Notice that it is no longer necessary to define the action procedures before loading
            of the mirror functions.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            Filenames with &#39;&lt;&#39; and &#39;&gt;&#39; cause problems in Windows XP. From this version
            of LAML, the Scheme Elucidator does not emit such file names.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            A new XML-in-LAML
            <a href="../styles/xml-in-laml/manual/man/manual.html">manual facility</a>
            has been developed. It can be used to write manuals for Scheme software. It
            also serves as a convenient interface to SchemeDoc, which extracts interface document
            from Scheme source programs. Finally, the new LAML manual facility can
            be used to extract and format document from an XML DTD.
            <p></p>
            The new LAML manual facility uses XHTML and CSS stylesheets. You can
            easily change the manual stylesheet for all LAML manuals by executing one
            of the scripts in the directory
            <kbd>css-stylesheets/change-manual-stylesheet/</kbd>.
            You can also make your own CSS stylesheets for you manuals.
            <p></p>
            The 
            <a href="../tutorial/schemedoc/schemedoc.html">
               LAML tutorial chapter on SchemeDoc and the LAML manual
            </a>
             has been rewritten to take the new manual facilities into account.
            <p></p>
            See also the new
            <a href="http://www.cs.auc.dk/~normark/schemedoc/">SchemeDoc home page</a>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            A new interactive command,
            <a href="../man/laml.html#xml-dtd-manual"><kbd>xml-dtd-manual</kbd></a>,
            can be used to make a LAML manual (in SchemeDoc) style of an XML DTD.
            This command can be used from an interactive LAML prompt, such as obtained by M-x
            <kbd>run-laml-interactively</kbd>
            in Emacs.
            The command
            <kbd>xml-dtd-manual</kbd>
            is defined and documented in the fundamental LAML setup file laml.scm.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            Similarly, the
            <a href="../man/laml.html#schemedoc"><kbd>schemedoc</kbd></a>
            command can be used to start the SchemeDoc tool. And
            <a href="../man/laml.html#xml-dtd-parse"><kbd>xml-dtd-parse</kbd></a>
            can be used to parse and XML DTD. Finall, the command
            <a href="../man/laml.html#generate-xml-mirror">generate-xml-mirror</a>
            can be used to generate a mirror in Scheme of an XML language.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            In versions earlier than LAML 23, each tripple of laml-platform, operating-system,
            scheme-system had its own Emacs file for LAML processing. This caused
            a substantial overlap of E-lisp source definitions, and it was quite difficult
            to make a new set of LAML processing E-lisp functions.
            <p></p>
            From version 22 these different files have been eliminated. Instead all the LAML
            processing commands are joined in the file
            <kbd>emacs-support/laml-execute.el</kbd>.
            The variations accross platforms, operating systems, and Scheme systems are
            accommodated in the two E-lisp functions
            <kbd>start-laml-process</kbd>
            and
            <kbd>call-laml-process</kbd>.
            Both of these are defined in the initial part of
            <kbd>emacs-support/laml-execute.el</kbd>.
         </li>
         <li style="margin-bottom:4mm;">
            It is now possible to start or call (asynchronously or synchronously) a LAML process
            on a LAML file directly from dired. Dired is the Emacs directory editor.
            Try
            <b><kbd>M-x dired</kbd></b>.
            Two new keybindings (the same used for processing a LAML files, from
            inside a LAML file, C-c C-0 and C-c C-x C-o with the hygienic key bindings) have
            been introduced. They are bound to the E-lisp commands
            <kbd>laml-process-selected-file-from-dired</kbd>
            and
            <kbd>laml-process-selected-multiple-files-from-dired</kbd>.
             The first processes the selected file asynchronously. The second one
            may process several selected files synchronously. These commands are
            also available via Dired&#39;s operate menu.

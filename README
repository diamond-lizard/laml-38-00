This is the directory where all LAML related software is organized.

In some distributions, only a subset of the LAML software is provided.
And depending on the distribution, this directory also includes a number
of HTML documentation files.

Bring index.html up in an Internet browser to get additional information.
You should also be aware of the LAML tutorial in tutorial/index.html

The file distribution-version.lsp contains a list of (v1 v2 t kind), where
v1 is the major version number, v2 is the minor version number, t is the 
time of generation (the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970),
and kind is either the string "full", "slim", or "development".
Example: (27 0 1113809304 "development").
The file distribution-version holds the same information on a textually
aggregated form (mostly for backward compatibility).
Example: Version 27.0 (April 18, 2005, development)

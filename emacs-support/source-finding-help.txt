FINDING DEFINITIONS.

The main idea with this feature is to allow navigation from an applied name to its definition.
It works separately for Scheme and ELisp source files.
The navigation can take place across a number of different source files.

F7 searches for the definition of the name under point.
F5 goes back the chain to the location before the previous finding operation.
F6 goes forward the chain without searching. 
S-F7 searches similarly to F7, but it starts a new chain.

M-x add-current-source-file-for-finding-definitions:
Adds the current source file so that it can be searched.

M-x remove-current-source-file-for-finding-definitions ()
Delete the current source file from the list of files that are searched.

M-x info-about-source-file-for-finding-definitions
Gives information about the files that are searched.

All commands mentioned above are also located in the Scheme/Emacs-Lisp menus.
